abstract = {Climate change is impacting species and ecosystems globally. Many existing templates to identify the most important areas to conserve terrestrial biodiversity at the global scale neglect the future impacts of climate change. Unstable climatic conditions are predicted to undermine conservation investments in the future. This paper presents an approach to developing a resource allocation algorithm for conservation investment that incorporates the ecological stability of ecoregions under climate change. We discover that allocating funds in this way changes the optimal schedule of global investments both spatially and temporally. This allocation reduces the biodiversity loss of terrestrial endemic species from protected areas due to climate change by 22{\%} for the period of 2002-2052, when compared to allocations that do not consider climate change. To maximize the resilience of global biodiversity to climate change we recommend that funding be increased in ecoregions located in the tropics and/or mid-elevation habitats, where climatic conditions are predicted to remain relatively stable. Accounting for the ecological stability of ecoregions provides a realistic approach to incorporating climate change into global conservation planning, with potential to save more species from extinction in the long term.},

abstract = {In this study the Brazilian Amazonian species of Acanthoscurria Ausserer, 1871 are redescribed: A. geniculata (C.L. Koch, 1841), A. tarda Pocock, 1903, A. juruenicola Mello-Leit{\~{a}}o, 1923, A. theraphosoides (Doleschall, 1871). Acanthoscurria simoensi Vol, 2000 and A. insubtilis Simon, 1892, previously known from French Guyana and Bolivia, respec- tively, are recorded for Brazil by the first time. The females of these two species are described for the first time and a new species, A. belterrensis sp. nov. , is described from Belterra, Par{\'{a}}, Brazil. In addition, four synonymies are established: A. transamazonica Piza, 1972 as junior synonym of A. geniculata ; A. ferina Simon, 1892 and A. brocklehursti F.O.P.-Cambridge, 1896 of A. theraphosoides ; and A. xinguensis Timotheo da Costa, 1960 of A. juruenicola. Acanthoscurria belterrensis sp. nov. resembles A. gomesiana Mello-Leit{\~{a}}o, 1923 by the color pattern and structure of sexual organs. The male can be distin- guished by the less curved embolus and the very projected prolateral superior and prolateral inferior keels, giving a triangular aspect to the basis of embolus, and the female seminal receptacles presenting a larger and narrower basis.},

abstract = {International and Canadian national and provincial level policy have proposed the use of criteria and indicators to examine the sustainability of renewable resource management. Species suitable as ecological indicators are those whose biology are sensitive to disturbance and therefore demonstrate a negative effect of management on the processes or functioning of the ecosystem. Ground dwelling invertebrates such as carabid beetles and spiders have strong potential as ecological indicators as they are readily surveyed in sufficient numbers for meaningful conclusions to be drawn, have a stable taxonomy and, at least in the case of ground beetles, are readily identified. They are good local scale indicators of ecosystem disturbance in forested landscapes at both the short and long time scales, responding to both clearcut logging and fire differently. Ground beetles and spiders in boreal Canada may not be good indicators of disturbance at landscape scales, as little response to the creation of forest edges and habitat fragmentation has so far been observed. We propose that these bioindicators be used as part of local-level validation monitoring to test hypotheses about disturbance impacts. In this way, bioindicators are used in a research setting to evaluate silvicultural practices, providing a rating of their sustainability for a given broad forest type grouping. ?? 2006.},

Our objective was to provide a synthetic treatment of the literature published in the last 21 years about sexual behaviour of mygalomorph spiders, in order to contribute in improving our understanding on the widespread and unique behaviours they exhibit. We provide a brief introduction to reproductive behaviour of mygalomorph spiders, and then examine some of the general patterns of courtship and mating behaviours known on some mygalomorph families.},

abstract = {Herein, we report observations about spider predation on anurans (adults and juveniles) in Central Amazonia and a literature review of spiders preying on amphibians in the Neotropical zoogeographic realm. We conducted field observations in Reserva Florestal Adolpho Ducke, Manaus, AM, and observed eight predation events on Bufonidae, Dendrobatidae, Hylidae, and Leptodactylidae frogs. The predators belong to the spider families Ctenidae, Pisauridae and Theraphosidae. Besides the families of spiders found in this study, two others - Lycosidae and Sparissidae - were found in literature. Frogs from families Centrolenidae and Microhylidae, and a caecilian (Gymnophiona, Caeciliidae) were found in literature also. There is a significant correlation between the length of the anuran (snout-vent length) and the length of spiders (cephalotorax and abdomen length). The size of the spider is similar or slightly lesser than the anuran prey. In general, the spiders preyed on adult and juvenile frogs in the breeding season. Spiders are opportunistic predators and prey on small frogs. Theraphosidae prey upon sub adults of large anurans and caecilians. As spiders can reach high densities on the forest floor - especially species of the genera Ctenus and Ancylometes - this interaction may be ecologically important for breeding anurans. Our reports and literature data provide evidence that spiders commonly prey on amphibians in Neotropic, but the impact of predation on populations of amphibians is unknown.},

abstract = {It is almost certainly the case that many populations have always existed as metapopulations, leading to the conclusion that local extinctions are common and normally balanced by migrations. This conclusion has major consequences for biodiversity conservation in fragmented tropical forests and the agricultural matrices in which they are embedded. Here we make the argument that the conservation paradigm that focuses on setting aside pristine forests while ignoring the agricultural landscape is a failed strategy in light of what is now conventional wisdom in ecology. Given the fragmented nature of most tropical ecosystems, agricultural landscapes should be an essential component of any conservation strategy. We review the literature on biodiversity in tropical agricultural landscapes and present evidence that many tropical agricultural systems have high levels of biodiversity (planned and associated). These systems represent, not only habitat for biodiversity, but also a high-quality matrix that permits the movement of forest organisms among patches of natural vegetation. We review a variety of agroecosystem types and conclude that diverse, low-input systems using agroecological principles are probably the best option for a high-quality matrix. Such systems are most likely to be constructed by small farmers with land titles, who, in turn, are normally the consequence of grassroots social movements. Therefore, the new conservation paradigm should incorporate a landscape approach in which small farmers, through their social organizations, work with conservationists to create a landscape matrix dominated by productive agroecological systems that facilitate interpatch migration while promoting a sustainable and dignified livelihood for rural communities.},

abstract = {Studying and protecting each and every living species on Earth is a major challenge of the 21st century. Yet, most species remain unknown or unstudied, while others attract most of the public, scientific and government attention. Although known to be detrimental, this taxonomic bias continues to be pervasive in the scientific literature, but is still poorly studied and understood. Here, we used 626 million occurrences from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), the biggest biodiversity data portal, to characterize the taxonomic bias in biodiversity data. We also investigated how societal preferences and taxonomic research relate to biodiversity data gathering. For each species belonging to 24 taxonomic classes, we used the number of publications from Web of Science and the number of web pages from Bing searches to approximate research activity and societal preferences. Our results show that societal preferences, rather than research activity, strongly correlate with taxonomic bias, which lead us to assert that scientists should advertise less charismatic species and develop societal initiatives (e.g. citizen science) that specifically target neglected organisms. Ensuring that biodiversity is representatively sampled while this is still possible is an urgent prerequisite for achieving efficient conservation plans and a global understanding of our surrounding environment.},

abstract = {Little is known of the impact of roads on insect mortality. This is a significant gap, because road verges are regarded as an important tool for insect conservation. In this study, we investigated which factors affect the number of roadkills in grassland butterflies and, simultaneously, the species composition and abundance on road verges. We established sixty transects, two hundred metres long, on roads in farmland areas and with differing traffic volume. Each transect consisted of two parallel lines, one on either side of the road. Ordination methods showed that the species composition of the butterflies killed on the roads was primarily explained by the species composition of those living on the road verges. At least 6.8{\%} of the butterflies were estimated to end up roadkilled. Also, the number of species and abundance of butterflies killed on the roads were positively dependent on both the abundance of butterflies on the road verges and on the traffic volume, but negatively correlated with the richness of plant species on the road verges. However, the proportion of individuals killed was negatively linked with the abundance of butterflies on the road verges, the richness of the plant species and the share of grassland in the landscape. There was a statistically significant tendency for small-bodied species to be overrepresented in the roadkill samples. Our results indicate that the verges which were of high conservation value for butterflies suffered the least from road mortality. The sowing of plant species, less frequent mowing and maintaining a high grassland cover in the vicinity of roads are recommended conservation actions for the improved conservation value of road verges for butterflies. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Despite their high diversity and importance for humankind, invertebrates are often neglected in biodiversity conservation policies. We identify seven impediments to their effective protection: (1) invertebrates and their ecological services are mostly unknown to the general public (the public dilemma); (2) policymakers and stakeholders are mostly unaware of invertebrate conservation problems (the political dilemma); (3) basic science on invertebrates is scarce and underfunded (the scientific dilemma); (4) most species are undescribed (the Linnean shortfall); (5) the distribution of described species is mostly unknown (the Wallacean shortfall); (6) the abundance of species and their changes in space and time are unknown (the Prestonian shortfall); (7) species ways of life and sensitivities to habitat change are largely unknown (the Hutchinsonian shortfall).Numerous recent developments in taxonomy, inventorying, monitoring, data compilation, statistical analysis and science communication facilitate overcoming these impediments in both policy and practice. We suggest as possible solutions for the public dilemma: better public information and marketing. For the political dilemma: red-listing, legal priority listing and inclusion in environmental impact assessment studies. For the scientific dilemma: parataxonomy, citizen science programs and biodiversity informatics. For the Linnean shortfall: biodiversity surrogacy, increased support for taxonomy and advances in taxonomic publications. For the Wallacean shortfall: funding of inventories, compilation of data in public repositories and species distribution modeling. For the Prestonian shortfall: standardized protocols for inventorying and monitoring, widespread use of analogous protocols and increased support for natural history collections. For the Hutchinsonian shortfall: identifying good indicator taxa and studying extinction rates by indirect evidence. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

While grassy field-tracks have no significant effect on the movement of arthropods, paved and gravel field-tracks stimulate longitudinal movements and reduce the rate of crossings. Similar results were found with mark-release-recapture experiments at a railway track. In modern agricultural landscapes the density of paved agricultural roads is increasing. Such linear infrastructures may hamper the dispersal of ground-foraging arthropods and reduce the immigration rate to isolated patches of natural or semi-natural habitats. ?? 1990.},

abstract = {1. The European Habitats Directive is the main legislative work regarding Europea's nature conservation policy. It lists the protected habitats and species in the European Union. The species lists include 122 arthropods. 2. The current lists of arthropods (Annexes II and IV) present, possibly among other, five obvious biases: taxonomic, geographic, range, size and aesthetic biases. Species of selected taxa (Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, Odonata and Orthoptera), from Northern or Central Europe, relatively widespread, of a large body size and attractive are favoured over species of other taxa, from southern and Mediterranean Europe, endemic or relatively small or inconspicuous. Such biases are obstacles to the effective protection of the European fauna. 3. Two main strategies should be followed to avoid these problems and therefore increase the effectiveness of conservation policies: (i) the adoption of objective and transparent criteria for the listing of protected species, and (ii) implement regular updates and amendments to the lists based on such criteria.},

abstract = {Highways and their roadside verges may substantially affect species dispersal, and the ecological effects of highways often extend to neighbouring areas. This study investigated the effects of highways on assemblages of ground-dwelling arthropods in neighbouring forest and open habitats. In total, 24 sites within five highway segments situated in the Czech Republic were sampled using transects of pitfall traps placed at increasing distances (0, 50 and 100. m) from the edge of highway verges. The total catch size and species richness of ground-dwelling spiders and beetles varied more strongly with distance from the highway edge in forest habitats than in open habitats. Species composition of both spiders and beetles was significantly affected by distance from the highway edge in open habitats as well as in forest habitats. In general, the species richness of forest specialist beetles (but not of spiders) was negatively affected by highway proximity in forested sites, whereas habitat generalists and open habitat specialists (both spiders and beetles) benefited from proximity to a highway in both forest and open habitats. Our results indicate that highway verges may potentially enhance local assemblages of ground dwelling spiders and beetles because they provide suitable sites (in intensively managed open landscapes) or dispersal corridors (in forested landscapes) for habitat generalists and open habitat specialist species. However, negative effects on forest specialists must also be considered, especially in landscapes with little forest. The landscape context should be given substantial consideration in future decisions about highway location because possible threats to forest specialists and benefits for other species must be recognised and balanced. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

The defensive behaviour of the species is determined to be based primarily on the avoidance of conflict situations, with overt aggressive behaviour seldom displayed. Although the opportunistic existence that this species has developed is probably obligatory due to their sedentary lifestyle and limited availability of resources, this behaviour nonetheless allows the species to occupy diverse habitats and exploit niches unavailable to more specialized species.},

abstract = {Lifespan is a life-history trait being of utmost importance, as it is frequently closely related to individual fitness. However, interspecific comparisons are relatively rare, being hampered by the high effort to collect longevity data across taxa. We here compiled lifespan data for 85 species of bird-eating spiders(Theraphosidae) held in captivity, based on 2183 individual records from the animal record books of both zoological gardens of Berlin, Germany. Using a data-mining approach we sought for broad patterns of correlations between lifespan and an array of other variables as derived from the literature. We found that the subfamily Eumenophoriinae lived on average longest, followed by the Theraphosinae, Ornithoctinae, Grammostolinae, Selenocosmiinae, Ischnocolinae and finally the Avicularinae. Species inhabiting tropical, more humid and/or low-altitude environments lived longer, suggesting that more predictable environments facilitate the evolution of longer lifespans. Furthermore, large range size, low abundance,sub-terrestrial life-style, and aggressive behavior were all associated with longer lifespans. Evidence for resource allocation trade-offs was revealed as larger spiderling and prosoma size was negatively related to longevity. Our rather rough approach revealed several patterns worth of future investigations, and illustrate the value of zoo records for interspecific comparisons. ?? 2013 Elsevier GmbH.},

The life span of adults was studied and the whole life span was estimated up to 30 years in female G. mollicoma, which seems to be a record for spiders. A comprehensive review of literature on theraphosid reproductive biology was undertaken. In the discussion, we consider the lengthy and costly sperm induction, the widespread display by body vibrations of courting males, multiple mating strategies of both sexes and the absence of sexual cannibalism.},

abstract = {1. Many arthropods are predators of vertebrates: four orders of the class arachnida, six orders of insecta, five orders of crustacea and one order of chilopoda include species that have been reported to eat vertebrates. At the population level, some arthropods are responsible for significant mortality among some vertebrates. 2. Arthropods are well equipped for this type of predation; many are larger than vertebrates (approximately 20{\%} of the vertebrate fauna of eastern North America is less than 10 cm in length), they may hunt in social groups and many have toxins or other adaptations that increase predatory efficiency. 3. Several arthropod predators and vertebrates may be involved in cross predation, the species eating each other. The switch in the role of predator and prey occurs during ‘ontogenetic reversal' as the vertebrate grows from small and vulnerable to large and predaceous. Cross predation decreases the future risk for one's self or offspring. 4. The opportunity for arthropod predation on vertebrates exists in many communities, but a review of some food webs catalogued by Cohen (1978) indicates that this particular link may be easily overlooked. Some arthropods should be investigated as potential predators of vertebrates. 5. The information available from the analysis of feeding interactions in a community should be an important link between field and theoretical ecology; however, most food webs are probably underestimates of the complexity that is commonplace.},

Evolutionary biologists have proposed different theories to explain how longevity variability may be driven by bad genes expression in late life or by gene pleiotropic effects. This reflexion has stimulated, in the last ten years, an active research on the proximal mechanisms that can shape lifespan. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), i.e., the by-products of oxidative metabolism, have emerged as the main proximate cause of ageing. Because ROS are mainly produced by the mitochondria, their production is linked to metabolic rate, and this may explain the differences in longevity between large and small species. However, their implication in the sex difference in longevity within a species has never been tested, despite the fact that these differences are widespread in the animal kingdom.},

abstract = {We describe the mating behavior in the spermatheca-lacking theraphosid species Sickius longibulbi Soares {\&} Camargo 1948. The behavior in captivity of nine pairs of S. longibulbi was videotaped and analyzed. The mating of this species presented an uncommon theraphosid pattern. There is little in the way of overt courtship by the male, the primary behavior seen being the male's use of legs I and II to touch the female's first pairs of legs and her chelicerae. Sometimes the male clasped one of the female's first pairs of legs, bringing her close to him. While the female raised her body, the male clasped her fangs and held her tightly with his legs III wrapped around her prosoma. The male seemed to try to knock the female down, pushing her entire body until she lay on her dorsum. In this phase we observed the male biting the female on the sternum or on the leg joints. When the female fell, the male attempted to position himself at an angle of 90u from the female. These movements appear to demand a lot of energy, particularly because the female is not passive during the mating. Our findings suggest that copulating in this position is, for the male, more successful than adopting other positions because it allows his extremely long palpal bulbs to deposit more sperm in the female oviduct where - since she lacks spermathecae - she retains the sperm. We suggest that the further he reaches into the oviduct, the greater the chance that he will fertilize the female's eggs.},

abstract = {First paragrph: As the newest addition to the Senior Editors of Insect Conservation and Diversity (ICD), it is a great pleasure for R.K.D. to be able to lead off this first issue of the journal for 2010. Throughout the second year of operation, our new journal has been growing and developing beyond all expectations, with continued high quality submissions by authors, and effective and timely handling of manuscripts by an exceptional team of Associate Editors. This success has been attributable, in no small measure, to the hardwork and commitment of BradHawkins as a Senior Editor over the last 2 years, and it is with great reluctance that we bid farewell to Brad fromthe journal and wish himevery success in his future role as Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Biogeography. With Brad's support, we saw a substantial increase in the number of submissions of high quality manuscripts to the journal in 2009, and a dramatic increase in the dissemination and uptake of ICD articles by the wider scientific community. Online access to articles increased 70{\%} over 2008 values, with an impressive annual average of over 200 abstract views and almost 150 downloads per article in 2009 (as estimated from data for January–September 2009, at the time of writing this editorial). Citation rates of articles onThompsonReuters ISIWeb of Science also increased dramatically in 2009, and although it is perhaps too early to judge how these will equate to future citation metrics for the journal, it is highly encouraging that current rates are approximately 65{\%} higher than those achieved for articles in comparable journals, such as the Journal of Insect Conservation, at the same point in their citation history. This strongly suggests to us that the wider fields of insect conservation and diversity are burgeoning areas of scientific research, and that ICD is meeting the need for a high quality platform for authors to highlight their findings, and express their views.},

abstract = {Because spiders occupy intermediate trophic levels in terrestrial food webs, measuring the extent to which predation by top predators limits spider numbers improves our ability to predict patterns of top-down limitation in terrestrial systems. We determined the degree to which vertebrate predation limits densities of Schizocosa, a genus of wolf spider abundant in leaf litter of the forest floor. In a Ii-mo experiment encompassing {\textgreater} 1 Schizocosa generation, we excluded birds and removed small mammals, lizards and amphibians from 5 fenced 50-m(2) plots. Schizocosa densities in the vertebrate-exclusion plots did not become significantly larger than densities in 5 open reference areas (P = 0.11). On the contrary, numbers of Schizocosa tended to be lower in the Removal-Exclusion treatment after the first two census dates. This pattern is evidence that vertebrate natural enemies do not limit densities of this common wolf spider.},

abstract = {In northern Europe at least, extensive knowledge of the systematics and ecology of spiders leads the authors to consider them as a very suitable group for pest limitation and for biodiagnostic purposes. An examination of both the qualitative and quantitative aspects of perdition by spider populations and communities is discussed as well as the evolution of some human factors occurring in agroecosystems that are likely to induce changes in spider predation such as chemical spraying and cultural practices. Studies addressing the recolonisation of agroecosystems by spiders, taking into account their dispersing abilities and habitat selection are summarised, followed by a discussion of the global efficiency of spiders as predators in such environments, the risks associated with their use and how to maximise their efficiency. The bioindicative value of spiders is presented by referring successively to population level and community level. The growth rate or the reproductive rate observed in natural populations can be correlated with the amount of prey ingested in the field. Thus, these parameters give an indirect estimation of the habitat quality. Two specific field experiments are presented to illustrate this ecological concept. Moreover, the role of spiders as indicators of heavy metal pollution (atmospheric or soil pollution) integrated by organisms living close to sources of pollution is discussed by reference to a set of laboratory and field experiments. Due to the close correspondence between the vegetation architecture and the composition of the associated spider community, it is argued (with a list of examples) that fluctuations in the spider community structure allows the bioevaluation of human disturbances. Based on the composition of the spider communities, methods of ecological classifications of natural habitats in several European countries are presented.},

abstract = {Herein, we report observations about spider predation on anurans (adults and juveniles) in Central Amazonia and a literature review of spiders preying on amphibians in the Neotropical zoogeographic realm. We conducted field observations in Reserva Florestal Adolpho Ducke, Manaus, AM, and observed eight predation events on Bufonidae, Dendrobatidae, Hylidae, and Leptodactylidae frogs. The predators belong to the spider families Ctenidae, Pisauridae and Theraphosidae. Besides the families of spiders found in this study, two others - Lycosidae and Sparissidae - were found in literature. Frogs from families Centrolenidae and Microhylidae, and a caecilian (Gymnophiona, Caeciliidae) were found in literature also. There is a significant correlation between the length of the anuran (snout-vent length) and the length of spiders (cephalotorax and abdomen length). The size of the spider is similar or slightly lesser than the anuran prey. In general, the spiders preyed on adult and juvenile frogs in the breeding season. Spiders are opportunistic predators and prey on small frogs. Theraphosidae prey upon sub adults of large anurans and caecilians. As spiders can reach high densities on the forest floor - especially species of the genera Ctenus and Ancylometes - this interaction may be ecologically important for breeding anurans. Our reports and literature data provide evidence that spiders commonly prey on amphibians in Neotropic, but the impact of predation on populations of amphibians is unknown.},

abstract = {Road edge effects cover extensive areas and exert a wide range of ecological influences on nearby plants and animals. Most studies have focused on individual and population level effects of the road edge; less is known about how communities and their functionality are altered in proximity to roads. Here, we studied the effect of road edges on species richness, rarity, endemism, composition, and functional (trophic) classification of communities of plants, ground-dwelling arthropods (beetles, spiders, scorpions, diplopods), and small mammals. The study, conducted in a Mediterranean ecosystem in central Israel, included sampling of these taxa in 10 plots adjacent to a regional road, and in 12 nearby control plots located in a typical shrubland habitat. We found a variety of community level road edge effects on the structure, composition, and function of the studied communities. The extent of effects varied among taxa, but they were generally positive or neutral. For the species-rich taxa (plants, beetles, and spiders), distinct road edge communities characterized by higher richness and altered species composition were found. Rarity and endemism were lower, and the proportion of disturbance-associated plant species was higher at the road edge. Among the species-poor taxa, scorpions and small mammals were more abundant along road edges than in control plots, while diplopods, the only negatively affected taxon, showed decreased abundance along the road. No ecologically meaningful changes in richness or composition were detected for the species-poor taxa along the road edge. Road edges profoundly affect floral and faunal communities, with possible implications for biodiversity conservation.},

abstract = {1. A thorough inventory of a Mediterranean oak forest spider fauna carried out during 2 weeks is presented. It used a semi-quantitative sampling protocol to collect comparable data in a rigorous, rapid and efficient way. Four hundred and eighty samples of one person-hour of work each were collected, mostly inside a delimited 1-ha plot. 2. Sampling yielded 10 808 adult spiders representing 204 species. The number of species present at the site was estimated using five different richness estimators (Chao1, Chao2, Jackknife1, Jackknife2 and Michaelis–Menten). The estimates ranged from 232 to 260. The most reliable estimates were provided by the Chao estimators and the least reliable was obtained with the Michaelis–Menten. However, the behavior of the Michaelis–Menten accumulation curves supports the use of this estimator as a stopping or reliability rule. 3. Nineteen per cent of the species were represented by a single specimen (singletons) and 12{\%} by just two specimens (doubletons). The presence of locally rare species in this exhaustive inventory is discussed. 4. The effects of day, time of day, collector experience and sampling method on the number of adults, number of species and taxonomic composition of the samples are assessed. Sampling method is the single most important factor influencing the results and all methods generate unique species. Time of day is also important, in such way that each combination of method and time of day may be considered as a different method in itself. There are insignificant differences between the collectors in terms of species and number of adult spiders collected. Despite the high collecting effort, the species richness and abundance of spiders remained constant throughout the sampling period.},

abstract = {Grammostola schulzei (Schmidt 1994) comprises a medium-bodied tarantula. Recently the species was found in Sierra de la Ventana, Buenos Aires, Argentina, where it lives in burrow always made under stones in rocky hills. Our objective was to offer a detailed description of courtship and mating, heretofore unknown, and to determine, under laboratory conditions, where copulation takes place; in the open field as proposed for all species of Grammostola, or at the entrance of the burrow. We carried out two series of experiments, completing 40 trials (20 in open arenas and 20 in burrowing arenas). All males initiated sexual behavior after contact with female silk. Courtship involved palpation, palpal drumming, body vibrations, and leg tapping. Palpation and palpal drumming appeared to operate in different ways. Females displayed typical behavior of a burrowing tarantula, making rapid bouts of tapping vigorously with the first pair of legs and palps. The mating position observed was typical of mygalomorphs, in which the female raises her body up and opens her fangs, the male uses the tibial apophyses to clasp the female's fangs, and finally begins a series of attempts at palpal insertion. The smooth slapping during clasping may serve to keep the female passive and relaxed. The dorsal flexion observed during mating and the number of successful matings in open arenas suggests that copulation would take place outside the burrow. We observed sexual cannibalism during the interactions but in these cases, we registered no previous courtships by the males.},

abstract = {Roadsides form potential habitats for several grassland species adapted to regular mowing management. We studied the communities of butterflies and day-active moths in 51 sites along the verges of the three road types, i.e., highways, urban roads and rural roads. Despite different traffic densities and widths of the road and verge, the groups were rather similar with regard to soil properties, vegetation structure and mowing intensity. The species richness and total abundance of butterflies (53 species, 5964 individuals) and diurnal moths (46 species, 4626 individuals) were also rather similar in each road type, although a preference for wider verges was observed. Butterfly diversity increased (but not significantly) from the verges of narrow rural roads to wider highways. The highest numbers of meadow species were recorded along highways and the total abundance, especially of diurnal moths, decreased in accordance with the road size. High nectar abundance was the most important factor increasing the numbers of meadow butterflies along road verges, while meadow moths were mostly favoured by shelter provided by tall vegetation. Verges surrounded by cultivated fields were generally related to low numbers of both Lepidoptera groups, whereas adjacent forests increased the total number of all species and favoured several butterflies inhabiting forest edges. The adjacent environment inflicted compositional differences on the Lepidoptera fauna of the three road types. The results indicate that road verges should be considered an important reserve for species dependent on semi-natural grasslands in Finland. A growing interest in accommodating current roadside management for conserving biodiversity is likely to benefit Lepidoptera communities in the verge habitats. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Spatial distribution, burrow morphology, phenology, defensive displays and predation of two theraphosid spiders living in meadows were studied in Uruguay. Exhaustive field studies complemented with laboratory observations were carried out. Eupalaestrus weijenberghi occurred throughout the country while Acanthoscurria suina occurred only in the southern half. Both species seemed to be the most abundant theraphosid spiders in Uruguay as they live in the dominant landscape of the country. Burrows from both species showed a similar morphological pattern but a terminal narrow tube was found only in E. weijenberghi. We observed that A. suina always co-occurred with E. weijenberghi but this species frequently occurred in the absence of the former. When co-occurring A. suina showed an aggregated distribution while E. weijenberghi was randomly distributed. A restricted reproductive period was found for both species, mainly between March and April, evidenced by the massive presence of walking adult males and then confirmed by pit-fall traps. Moulting, oviposition and longevity were also studied. Conspicuous species-specific defensive behaviours were displayed by the tarantulas in all cases, when collected. These tarantulas showed spatial co-occurrence and temporal coexistence with the beetle Diloboderus abderus, an important pest of grasslands. Tarantula predation on adult beetles was confirmed, these spiders being one of the few beetle predators. Their maximal efficiency in beetle predation could reach 65 000 prey captured per hectare by month. These polyphagous tarantulas seem to be potential agents for the biological control of beetle pests.},

abstract = {To determine the effect of lizards on webspider populations, we conducted a long-term field experiment in the Bahamas. Numbers of spider individuals were about 3 times higher in lizard-removal enclosures than in control enclosures with natural densities of lizards. Dietary analyses showed that lizards ate spiders and that lizard and spider diets overlapped substantially. Lizards reduced biomass of prey consumed by spiders; details indicated that they reduced biomass of large ({\textgreater} 4 mm) prey consumed by spiders more than biomass of small (≤4 mm) prey. Similarly, lizards reduced biomass of large aerial arthropods caught in sticky traps but not biomass of small aerial arthropods. We found no evidence that the lizard effect on prey consumption by spiders was caused by a spatial shift from areas with high aerial arthropod abundance to areas with low aerial arthropod abundance. Lizards reduced adult female cephalothorax width and fecundity of spiders. In a separate experiment, food-supplemented spiders were more fecund than control spiders. This study indicates that the interaction between lizards and spiders includes both predation and competition for food.},

abstract = {Intra-specific variation in life history and mating strategies can lead to differences in energy allocation and expenditure in males and females. This may, in turn, explain large-scale evolutionary patterns. In this study, I investigated the effects of body mass, temperature and sex on resting metabolic rates (RMRs) in sexually mature male and female tarantulas (Aphonopelma anax (Chamberlin)), a species that exhibits extreme inter-sexual differences in life history after reaching sexual maturity. RMRs were measured as rates of CO 2 production in an open-flow respirometry system at 20, 25, 30 and 35°C. These temperatures are typical to what this species experiences under natural conditions. In addition, a respiratory quotient (RQ) of 0.92 was calculated from rates of CO2 production and O2 consumption in a closed, constant-volume respirometry system. As expected, RMRs increased with increasing temperature and body mass. However, after adjusting for the influence of body mass, males had substantially higher metabolic rates than females at each temperature. This higher metabolic rate is proposed as an adaptive strategy to support higher energetic demands for males during their active, locomotory search for females during the mating season. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The effects of small mammals on invertebrate prey populations in grassland were investigated by means of an exclosure experiment over a period of 2 yr. Using direct searches and suction sampling, numbers of invertebrates were compared in four experimental plots fenced to exclude small mammals and four control plots where they had free access. There was no evidence of differences in guild structure or species composition in either large or small invertebrates as a result of mammal predation, but numbers of large invertebrates were consistently and significantly smaller (by 22.7-64.8{\%}) in the presence of mammals, due principally to the predatory effects of shrews. Most affected were populations of Isopoda, Mollusca, Myriapoda, Araneae and Opiliones. Numbers of less commonly occurring invertebrate taxa, such as Coleoptera, showed more erratic differences between control and experimental plots. Numbers of small invertebrates collected by suction sampling were highly variable and, although often reduced in the presence of mammals, the treatment differences were not always significant. It is concluded that small mammal predators, with their capacity for high population densities and consumption rates, have a major effect on invertebrate communities in grassland.},

abstract = {During the mating season, male tarantulas abandon their burrows and actively search for widely distributed females, which remain fossorial. As a result, males are exposed to larger fluctuations in environmental conditions without the protection of a permanent retreat. Body temperatures (Tb) of active male tarantulas (Aphonopelma anax) encountered fortuitously in the field ranged from 24.7 to 35.1°C and preferred Tb's measured in a laboratory thermal gradient ranged from 22.1 to 31.3°C. The thermal options available to males at random points in their environment varied substantially throughout the day but temperatures typically exceeded 40°C. In comparison, temperatures within burrows remained below 40°C. Indices calculated from these temperature data suggested that males thermoregulated effectively during the day, while environmental temperatures were within their preferred Tb range at night and so active regulation of Tb was unnecessary. In addition, I determined the exact times that males ceased locomotory activity in the morning (retreat) and when they started activity in the evening (emergence). Data from 23 radio-tagged males indicated that they retreated into temporary burrows between 06:47 and 10:53 CST. Activity commenced again between 16:36 and 20:53 CST as temperatures approached their preferred or selected Tb range.},

Acanthoscurria suina Pocock, 1903 and Eupalaestrus weijenberghi (Thorell, 1894) are two sympatric and synchronic tarantulas that inhabit burrows in Uruguay's meadows. Here we test how and when reproductive isolation operates between these species. We exposed females of each species simultaneously to two males: either one male of each species, or two males of the same species. Males courted females of both species. Contrary to expectations, however, females of A. suina responded more effusively to heterospecific than to conspecific males, whereas females of E. weijenberghi only responded to conspecific males. Clasping (prelude of mating) was only recorded for couples of the same species. Females of A. suina at first seem to prefer the stronger body vibrations performed by heterospecific courting males than by males of their own species. {\textcopyright} 2013 Sociedade Brasileira de Zoologia All rights reserved.},

We staged a manipulative experiment to assess the effectiveness of self-made shelters by web spiders as protection from natural enemies. Scincid lizards were included or excluded from 21 replicated 200-m(2) plots, and spiders therein were classified as exposed or sheltered, depending on whether they were uncovered in their web or hidden in cocoons, leaves/debris, or burrows. We found that exposed spiders were greatly affected by the presence of predatory scincid lizards, whereas sheltered spiders were not. More specifically, lizards, which forage close to the ground, reduced the abundance of exposed spiders by two-thirds but had no effect on the abundance of sheltered spiders. Sheltered spiders were able to avoid predation and share space with lizards, suggesting that shelter construction is a mechanism for reducing predation risk and has important population consequences.},

abstract = {Spatial distribution, burrow morphology, phenology, defensive displays and predation of two theraphosid spiders living in meadows were studied in Uruguay. Exhaustive field studies complemented with laboratory observations were carried out. Eupalaestrus weijenberghi occurred throughout the country while Acanthoscurria suina occurred only in the southern half. Both species seemed to be the most abundant theraphosid spiders in Uruguay as they live in the dominant landscape of the country. Burrows from both species showed a similar morphological pattern but a terminal narrow tube was found only in E. weijenberghi. We observed that A. suina always co-occurred with E. weijenberghi but this species frequently occurred in the absence of the former. When co-occurring A. suina showed an aggregated distribution while E. weijenberghi was randomly distributed. A restricted reproductive period was found for both species, mainly between March and April, evidenced by the massive presence of walking adult males and then confirmed by pit-fall traps. Moulting, oviposition and longevity were also studied. Conspicuous species-specific defensive behaviours were displayed by the tarantulas in all cases, when collected. These tarantulas showed spatial co-occurrence and temporal coexistence with the beetle Diloboderus abderus, an important pest of grasslands. Tarantula predation on adult beetles was confirmed, these spiders being one of the few beetle predators. Their maximal efficiency in beetle predation could reach 65 000 prey captured per hectare by month. These polyphagous tarantulas seem to be potential agents for the biological control of beetle pests.},

abstract = {The loss of apex predators is known to have reverberating consequences for ecosystems, but how changes in broader predator assemblages affect vital ecosystem functions and services is largely unknown. Predators and their prey form complex interaction networks, in which predators consume not only herbivores but also other predators. Resolving these interactions will be essential for predicting changes in many important ecosystem functions, such as the control of damaging crop pests. Here, we examine how birds, bats, and arthropods interact to determine herbivorous arthropod abundance and leaf damage in Costa Rican coffee plantations. In an exclosure experiment, we found that birds and bats reduced non-flying arthropod abundance by -35{\%} and -25{\%}, respectively. In contrast, birds and bats increased the abundance of flying arthropods, probably by consuming spiders. The frequency of this intraguild predation differed between birds and bats, with cascading consequences for coffee shrubs. Excluding birds caused a greater increase in herbivorous arthropod abundance than excluding bats, leading to increased coffee leaf damage. Excluding bats caused an increase in spiders and other predatory arthropods, increasing the ratio of predators to herbivores in the arthropod community. Bats, therefore, did not provide benefits to coffee plants. Leaf damage on coffee was low, and probably did not affect coffee yields. Bird-mediated control of herbivores, however, may aid coffee shrubs in the long-term by preventing pest outbreaks. Regardless, our results demonstrate how complex, cascading interactions between predators and herbivores may impact plants and people.},

abstract = {The road tarantula Eupalaestrus weijenberghi shows a strongly female-biased sex ratio since adult females live several years while adult males live only for 2 months. In this scenario selective males could be expected. However, several factors such as the rates of reproduction of each sex, degree of sexual selectivity and synchronicity of female receptiveness determine the operational sexual ratio and mating system of the species. Our objective was to determine the mating rates and mating tactics for females and males of E. weijenberghi and their variation throughout the reproductive period. Four hundred sexual encounters among 20 females and 20 males in all possible pair-wise combinations were carried out during 29 days, a brief but intense experimental period, as it also occurs in the field. Mating success differed strongly between sexes. Females mated once: five females mated at the first attempt, eight initially rejected males and copulated in subsequent attempts. Half of the males did not copulate and the others copulated 1-3 times. Mated females actively rejected males. Results indicate a mating system with monogamous females and polygamous males. Not all the females were receptive in every reproductive season. We suggest that female monogamy drastically affects the operational sex ratio, since several females were unreceptive after a single copulation, directly diminishing the male potential reproductive rate. This is the first experimental approach to estimate tarantula mating systems, their determinants and the consequences of the strategies shown by each sex. ?? 2007 Elsevier GmbH.

We provide a critical synthesis of the scientific insights that guide our understanding of patterns and processes underpinning forest biodiversity in the human-modified tropics, and present a conceptual framework that integrates a broad range of social and ecological factors that define and contextualize the possible future of tropical forest species. A growing body of research demonstrates that spatial and temporal patterns of biodiversity are the dynamic product of interacting historical and contemporary human and ecological processes. These processes vary radically in their relative importance within and among regions, and have effects that may take years to become fully manifest. Interpreting biodiversity research findings is frequently made difficult by constrained study designs, low congruence in species responses to disturbance, shifting baselines and an over-dependence on comparative inferences from a small number of well studied localities. Spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the potential prospects for biodiversity conservation can be explained by regional differences in biotic vulnerability and anthropogenic legacies, an ever-tighter coupling of human-ecological systems and the influence of global environmental change. These differences provide both challenges and opportunities for biodiversity conservation. Building upon our synthesis we outline a simple adaptive-landscape planning framework that can help guide a new research agenda to enhance biodiversity conservation prospects in the human-modified tropics. {\textcopyright} 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

abstract = {Few studies have evaluated the animals' capacity of inter-patch movement, which contributed to the buildup over the years of approaches that use a target species to represent and protect the local biodiversity. Recently, the 'ecoprofiles' approach, seeks to fill some gaps left by other approaches. The ecoprofiles taking into account three main characteristics (type of ecosystem, area requirements and capacity of inter-patch movement) of target species, which may serve as representatives of a range of species that do not possess such information and demanding 'similar' ecological requirements. Here, we performed a scientometric study on the subject of inter-patch movement, focusing on Atlantic Forest species. We also evaluated the possible use of ecoprofiles approach for this biome. In a general view, Brazil contributed with 0.005{\%} to the total of published articles worldwide on the subject, which permit to conclude that the Brazilian contribution on the subject is still recent and restricted. Focusing in the Atlantic Forest biome, we found 24 papers published until January 2010, 15 of which presented explicit results on inter-patch movement for Atlantic Forest species. Among these 15 papers, the most common objective was to evaluate the species' dispersal capacity (the capacity to cross the matrix from one remnant forest to another). The non-volant mammals were the most frequent group in the articles and the birds showed the highest number of species studied. Only birds and small mammals were studied, probably because they are easily found and captured in remnant forests. This fact resulted in low values of inter-patch movement found for Atlantic Forest species. Moreover, this contribution presents a strong regional bias, since the state of Rio de Janeiro contributed all information about the subject for non-volant mammals and S{\~{a}}o Paulo for birds. Considering all the studies analyzed, although several aspects of the issue have been addressed, it is clear that knowledge about the ability to shift in the matrix is still very restricted. This fact, coupled with the lack of information on area requirements of the species, makes it virtually impossible to apply the ecoprofiles approach for the Atlantic Forest, at least in the short term.},

abstract = {The spiny rats of the genus Trinomys Thomas, 1921 have a broad distribution in the Atlantic Forests of southeastern Brazil. However, some species are known only from their type locality and adjacent areas. In our study, nine areas in the state of Rio de Janeiro were surveyed and three species of the genus were captured - Trinomys dimidiatus (G{\"{u}}nther, 1877), T. setosus (Desmarest, 1817) and T. gratiosus bonafidei (Moojen, 1948). We extended the distribution of T. gratiosus bonafidei in 100 km, in a straight line to the northwest, and into an area of Semidecidual Seasonal Forest. We captured T. setosus, which had not been previously recorded in the state, in the municipality of Cambuci, extending its distribution 150 km, in a straight line to the east of its closest record, in Juiz de Fora, state of Minas Gerais. The state of Rio de Janeiro has now six recognized species of Trinomys, however none of them were collected above 1300 m of altitude. We used occurrence points provided by our inventories data and from the literature to model the potential distribution of Trinomys species. We used climatic, topographic and phytogeographic variables to prepare the potential distribution maps. The algorithm used for modeling was provided by the software Maxent, version 3.2.1. Although species boundaries within Trinomys in Rio de Janeiro State are not yet clear, their distributions seem to be parapatric, except for T. iheringi and T. dimidiatus. {\textcopyright} 2009 Sociedade Brasileira de Zoologia.},

abstract = {Subsistence game hunting has profound negative effects on the species diversity, standing biomass, and size structure of vertebrate assemblages in Amazonian forests that otherwise remain largely undis- turbed. These effects are likely to be considerably aggravated by forest fragmentation because fragments are more accessible to hunters, allow no (or very low rates of ) recolonization from nonharvested source popula- tions, and may provide a lower-quality resource base for the frugivore-granivore vertebrate fauna. I exam- ined the likelihood of midsized to large-bodied bird and mammal populations persisting in Amazonian forest fragments of variable sizes whenever they continue to be harvested by subsistence hunters in the aftermath of isolation. I used data from a comprehensive compilation of game-harvest studies throughout Neotropical for- ests to estimate the degree to which different species and populations have been overharvested and then cal- culated the range of minimum forest areas required to maintain a sustainable harvest. The size distribution of 5564 Amazonian forest fragments—estimated from Landsat images of six regions of southern and eastern Brazilian Amazonia—clearly shows that these are predominantly small and rarely exceed 10 ha, suggesting that persistent overhunting is likely to drive most midsized to large vertebrate populations to local extinction in fragmented forest landscapes. Although experimental studies on this negative synergism remain largely unavailable, the prospect that increasingly fragmented Neotropical forest regions can retain their full assem- blages of avian and mammalian species is unlikely.},

abstract = {Use of shelters by the Neotropical river otter (Lontra longicaudis) was studied in a headwater stream of the Atlantic Forest, southeastern Brazil, during 1994. L. longicaudis used almost all types of natural cavities available along river banks, and they excavated burrows or found shelter in dense grass. Two large caves were used as shelters and also to raise young. The degree of conservation of the forest and human disturbance around the shelters did not influence use by otters. However, otters used shelters located higher on the river banks more frequently, probably because they were less vulnerable to flooding. Considering all shelters found during 1 year, shelters of L. longicaudis were distributed at random along the stream, and scent marks were not concentrated around them. Number of shelters in use per month was constant throughout the year, indicating that this can be used to monitor populations of river otters.},

abstract = {Understanding a species' occurrence requirements is essential for its conservation, and species distribution models (SDMs) are a powerful tool for this purpose. Here we estimated a SDM based on actual distribution information, in relation to climatic, hydrological, human population, and vegetation data sets, to understand the ecological requirements and geographic distribution of the Neotropical otter Lontra longicaudis, a species whose habitat requirements and conservation needs are mostly unknown. Using MaxEnt, we defined its potential distribution and most suitable areas to indicate priority areas for research and to analyze the efficiency of Protected Areas (PAs). Our findings suggest that the range of Neotropical otters could extend beyond their present estimated distribution, adding new areas in northeastern Brazil, Andean region, west Ecuador, Venezuela, Peru, Mexico, and Argentina, with higher suitability in rain forests (especially Atlantic and Amazon Forests). We also found that PAs are the most suitable areas for otter distribution. Although better than non-protected areas, PAs are close to the median of the suitability values, indicating that they still can be improved to conserve otters. Annual temperature and human population density explained most data variance in our model. We suggest the change of the actual status of Neotropical otter to Least Concern or Near Threatened categories. We recommend verifying the possible sympatry with other otters, and demonstrate that rudimentary and/or occasional recent data of occurrence can also be used in SDMs and contribute to species conservation. {\textcopyright} Marcelo Lopes Rheingantz, Jorge Fernando Saraiva de Menezes and Benoit de Thoisy.},

Na {\'{a}}rea florestada a amostragem foi realizada em duas trilhas com fisionomias diferentes (Mata de Terra Firme e Mata de V{\'{a}}rzea). Foram registradas 103 esp{\'{e}}cies, sendo 50 de anf{\'{i}}bios anuros e 53 de r{\'{e}}pteis (35 serpentes, 17 lagartos e um crocodiliano). A curva do coletor atingiu a ass{\'{i}}ntota para os anf{\'{i}}bios anuros, mas n{\~{a}}o para os lagartos, serpentes e a herpetofauna (todos os grupos). Nas {\'{a}}reas florestadas foi registrada a maioria das esp{\'{e}}cies de anf{\'{i}}bios anuros, o mesmo sendo observado para os r{\'{e}}pteis, sendo que a maioria destes foi registrada na mata de terra firme. A maioria dos anf{\'{i}}bios foi registrada durante a PLT e a ASR, enquanto os r{\'{e}}pteis foram atrav{\'{e}}s de EO e tamb{\'{e}}m por PLT. Espera-se um n{\'{u}}mero maior de esp{\'{e}}cies de serpentes para a localidade do que a riqueza registrada (35 esp{\'{e}}cies).

abstract = {This study evaluates the impact of hunting on mammalian and avian species in Atlantic forest fragments of the Mata de Planalto in the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Colonists who farm on the edge of fragments also hunt for subsistence within fragments. Hunters commonly take the two peccary species, tapir, bracket deer, armadillos and agoutis. Primates are rarely hunted in this region. Effects of hunting on species were measured by changes in relative abundance of species between four sites with similar sizes (approximately 2000 ha each), but different hunting pressures (two slightly hunted and two heavily hunted). In addition, one large protected area (35 000 ha) was also censused. Species abundances were measured during 18 months along 2287 km of line transects. Abundances of tapirs, bracket deer, white-lipped peccaries, armadillos and coatis decreased between slightly hunted and heavily hunted sites. Abundances of collared peccaries, agoutis, primates and guans did not show any trends with hunting pressure. Extirpations of tapirs and white-lipped peccaries at heavily hunted sites suggest that in forest remnants encroached by people, hunting exacerbates effects of fragmentation, such as genetics and demographics, and is probably the most important factor in emptying these forests of large species over the short-term.

abstract = {Context Increased edge density is among the main negative effects of habitat loss and fragmentation. Roads are linear infrastructures that may promote barrier effects due to disturbance and mortality effects. We hypothesized that edges of habitat patches bordered by roads are less permeable than roadless edges. Objectives Wetested whether edge permeability and avoidance are influenced by the presence of paved and dirt roads bordering habitat patches, relatively to roadless edges. Methods We translocated 55 montane akodonts (Akodon montensis) from the interior of vegetation remnants to their edges, and tracked fine-scale move- ments using spool-and-line devices. Edges were bordered by dirt roads (n = 12 mice), paved roads (n = 21) or were not bordered by roads (n = 22). We assessed edge permeability by comparing the number of tracks with crossings, and by comparing the empirical data to simulated correlated random walks. Wealso assessed edge avoidance by comparing the net direction travelled and net displacement from edge. Results No edge crossings were recorded in roaded edges, whereas 36{\%} of tracks in roadless edges crossed the edge at least once. Simulations indicated a significantly lower permeability of roaded edges, while the observed number of crossings in roadless edges was within the expected range. We found no evidence of higher avoidance of roaded edges, as both net direction travelled and displacement were similar across edge types. Conclusions Roads decreased edge permeability for the montane akodont. This is likely to increase population isolation among vegetation remnants by reducing the structural connectivity in the already fragmented landscape.},

Geographic situation, indicators of human activity such as highways and major urban centers, and environmental variables related with productivity, water availability, altitude, and environmental energy were included in a logistic model that correctly classified about 73{\%} of otter presences and absences. We extrapolated the model to the adjacent territory of Portugal, and increased the model's spatial resolution by extrapolating it to 1 x 1-km squares in the whole Iberian Peninsula. The model turned out to be rather flexible, predicting, for instance, the species to be very restricted to the courses of rivers in some areas, and more widespread in others. This allowed us to determine areas where otter populations may be more vulnerable to habitat changes or harmful human interventions. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Possums are known to eat more than 100 native plant species and a wide range of introduced plants. Diet varies markedly between regions but within any particular region is concentrated on a few plant species (Green 1984). In addition to plant material, possums will eat invertebrates (Gilmore 1967, Clout 1977, Warburton 1978, Morgan 1981, Cowan {\&} Moeed 1987) and small vertebrates, such as birds (Perham 1924, Morgan 1981) and mice (Cowan 1990). Captive possums readily accept meat (Cowan 1990). This article describes remains left by possums that have fed on birds and their eggs. Feeding trials were carried out with captive possums to see whether they would eat dead birds and eggs and to see what sign remained after feeding. In addition, we have brought together various accounts of possums preying or scavenging on birds and other animals.},

abstract = {Road mortality due to animal vehicle collisions has serious negative effects on population viability, demanding urgent implementation of mitigation measures where most required. Data from roadkill surveys is generally used to choose the best mitigation measures, but there is a lack of knowledge about the sampling intensity required for surveys to effectively detect roadkill patterns. Improving the cost-effectiveness of road surveys could free up limited resources that, in turn, could be used to obtain a better perception of road impacts and mitigation effectiveness elsewhere. We evaluate the pos- sibility of improving road survey cost-effectiveness by comparing the spatial patterns obtained when using a weekly versus monthly survey and year-round versus seasonal surveys. We analyzed a roadkill dataset, previously collected over 2 years in southern Brazil, and applied two criteria for assessing the effectiveness of two alternative survey protocols: tradeoff between sampling effort and sample size; and similarity in spatial patterns. We found support favoring monthly surveys for those taxa in which roadkill was not markedly temporally clustered, as was the case for larger mammals. However, per- forming weekly surveys over shorter periods may significantly improve cost-effectiveness for taxa with peaks in mortality if surveys are performed during those periods when roadkill is most likely to occur. We suggest applying a mix of sampling protocols, with intensive surveys during warmer periods for reptiles and other taxa with peak roadkill at these times while, for the rest of the year, a monthly survey could be used to improve detection of rarer species.},

abstract = {The Neotropical otter Lontra longicaudis is a widespread semiaquatic carnivore living in a wide variety of environments in both fresh-water and salt-water ecosystems. We summarise the current knowledge on distribution, ecology, behaviour, evolution and conservation status of the species, and highlight the main threats that have been affecting it as well as priority actions for securing its survival. The current geographical range of Lontra longicaudis is discussed, as well as several efforts that have been made to update knowledge of the range. Throughout its known distribution area, the Neotropical otter has high genetic diversity, and recent molecular research suggests that variations in genetic diversity are related to geography. Taxonomic issues regarding the existence of subspecies persist, mainly due to limited sampling in key portions of the species' range. Although the Neotropical otter is widely distributed in Latin America and has flexible behaviour, it is subjected to a variety of threats, which lead this otter to be officially considered Threatened in several countries within its geographical range. The species still faces an uncertain future due to the impact of human activities, thus justifying its classification as Near Threatened in the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List. The real level of human-otter conflicts and the impact of modified environments on Neotropical otter populations are still unclear, and must be a priority focus of future studies. There is an urgent need to increase our knowledge on aspects of the Neotropical otter's biology, such as reproduction, generation time, behaviour, physiology, distribution limits, sanitary aspects, evolution and taxonomy. Understanding these topics is vital to ensure the long-term survival of the species, both at the local and at the regional scale, as well as to provide the basis for environmental education actions involving local riverside human communities.},

abstract = {The Neotropical river otter Lontra longicaudis is a top predator in many South and Central American aquatic freshwater systems. Its current category in the International Union for Conservation of Nature is "data deficient," which makes it imperative to determine the appropriate conservation status. We applied species distribution models to build a map of habitat suitabilities, and to identify possible anthropogenic factors that affect the presence of L. longicaudis in the Lower Delta of the Paran{\'{a}} River in the Southern Cone of South America. Presence/absence of L. longicaudis was obtained using 3 methodologies (sign surveys, camera traps, and interviews) and 15 environmental predictors. Habitat suitability was higher in areas with polders built for forestry, and lower in areas with human settlements and boat traffic. At present, geographic isolation and control of access on private land and reserves appear to be effective at protecting wildlife in the Paran{\'{a}} Delta. Our study demonstrates that species distribution models can be used for rapidly evaluating potential threats to wildlife. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Society of Mammalogists.},

abstract = {Scavenging is a widespread phenomenon in vertebrate communities which has rarely been accounted for, in spite of playing an essential role in food webs by enhancing nutrient recycling and community stability. Most studies on scavenger assemblages have often presented an oversimplified view of carrion foraging. Here, we applied for the first time the concept of nestedness to the study of a species-rich scavenger community in a forest ecosystem (Bia{\l}owieza Primeval Forest, Poland) following a network approach. By analysing one of the most complete datasets existing up to now in a pristine environment, we have shown that the community of facultative scavengers is not randomly assembled but highly nested. A nested pattern means that species-poor carcasses support a subset of the scavenger assemblage occurring at progressively species-rich carcasses. This result contradicts the conventional view of facultative scavenging as random and opportunistic and supports recent findings in scavenging ecology. It also suggests that factors other than competition play a major role in determining community structure. Nested patterns in scavenger communities appear to be promoted by the high diversity in carrion resources and consumers, the differential predictability of the ungulate carcass types and stressful environmental conditions.},

abstract = {Long term population monitoring is essential to ecological studies; however, field procedures may disturb individuals. Assessing this topic is important in worldwide declining taxa such as reptiles. Previous studies focussed on animal welfare issues and examined short-term effects (e.g. increase of stress hormones due to handling). Long-term effects with possible consequences at the population level remain poorly investigated. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of widely used field procedures (e.g. handling, marking, forced regurgitation) both on short-term (hormonal stress response) and on long-term (changes in body condition, survival) scales in two intensively monitored populations of sea kraits (Laticauda spp.) in New Caledonia. Focusing on the most intensively monitored sites, from 2002 to 2012, we gathered approximately 11 200 captures/recaptures on 4500 individuals. Each snake was individually marked (scale clipping + branding) and subjected to various measurements (e.g. body size, head morphology, palpation). In addition, a subsample of more than 500 snakes was forced to regurgitate their prey for dietary analyses. Handling caused a significant stress hormonal response, however we found no detrimental long-term effect on body condition. Forced regurgitation did not cause any significant effect on both body condition one year later and survival. These results suggest that the strong short-term stress provoked by field procedures did not translate into negative effects on the population. Although similar analyses are required to test the validity of our conclusions in other species, our results suggest distinguishing welfare and population issues to evaluate the potential impact of population surveys. {\textcopyright} Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2012.},

abstract = {The ability to detect trends in population abundance is of obvious interest to wildlife managers. In recent years, the probability of detecting defined population trends has been the most common method of assessing monitoring programs. Such analyses require many assumptions, including a model for population change and a model for variance. To demonstrate potential effects of these assumptions on power analysis results, we present data for Red-tailed Tropicbirds (Phaethon rubricauda) from Tern Island, Hawaii. Depending on our assumptions, the power to detect a 50{\%} decline over 10 years varied from 80{\%} to 100{\%}. We argue that monitoring standards based upon the ability to detect population trends should be applied cautiously. As a complementary approach, we propose that monitoring standards should emphasize attributes of sampling design that increase precision (e.g., randomization, bias, and detection probability). By using standards of precision, managers can focus on the sources of variation that can be minimized. A sampling design approach to monitoring standards provides a useful complement to standards of statistical power to detect annual trends.},

abstract = {We investigated the effects of both seed density and distance from conspecific adult trees on the survivorship of seeds of Shorea laxa and Dipterocarpus tempehes. We examined whether those species support predictions of the escape hypothesis of distance- and density-dependent mortality. We placed seeds on the forest floor using a matrix of distance from the parent tree (5, 20, and 80 m) and seed density (2, 10, and 50 m-2). The fates of seeds and seedlings were recorded 5 days, 2 weeks, and 1 month after the seeds were exposed. Camera-traps at quadrats 5 and 80 m from the parent trees were used to identify mammalian seed and seedling predators and to examine the frequency of their appearance. The proportion of seedlings surviving after 1 month was very small, 32.0 and 4.0{\%} for S. laxa and D. tempehes, respectively. The main cause of mortality for both species was predation and removal by mammals. Total mortality and mortality caused by mammal predation were highest at the greatest distance from the parent tree. Camera-traps revealed that the diversity of mammalian predators was highest 5 m from the parent trees, while the total frequency of mammalian predator appearance was higher at 80 m than at 5 m for S. laxa. Thus, S. laxa and D. tempehes exhibited distance-dependent mortality, but the highest mortality occurred at the greatest distance from the parent trees. This is the inverse of the pattern predicted by escape hypothesis and instead supports the "McCanny pattern". Those results would be caused by "predator satiation" near the seed-bearing trees where foods were concentrated, while seeds more distant from the parent tree were exhausted by predation. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The otters are specialist feeders (Bsta = 0.24), with a diet based mostly on fish, especially those of the families Loricariidae and Cichlidae. Most shelters used by the species were excavated burrows underneath tree roots, while shelters within rocks were used less frequently. The burrows showed great variation in size, being found on average 3.5 m (sd = 3.6 m) away from the margin and 2.5 m (sd = 1.2 m) above the water level. Scent marks were made preferentially on rocks and fallen tree trunks at the edge of the water.

abstract = {The relationship between biodiversity and the rapidly expanding research and policy field of ecosystem services is confused and is damaging efforts to create coherent policy. Using the widely accepted Convention on Biological Diversity definition of biodiversity and work for the UK National Ecosystem Assessment we show that biodiversity has key roles at all levels of the ecosystem service hierarchy: as a regulator of underpinning ecosystem processes, as a final ecosystem service and as a good that is subject to valuation, whether economic or otherwise. Ecosystem science and practice has not yet absorbed the lessons of this complex relationship, which suggests an urgent need to develop the interdisciplinary science of ecosystem management bringing together ecologists, conservation biologists, resource economists and others. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In this monograph, was studied non-geographic and geographic variation of taxa of Howling Monkeys, genus Alouatta Lac{\'{e}}p{\`{e}}de, 1799, occuring in Brazil, in order to solve the taxonomy of the group. For the morphological analysis, were examined a total of 1,286 specimens kept in five Brazilian and two North-American museums. The material consisted mostly of skin, skull and hyoid bone; skeleton or fluid-preserved specimens were scarse. The study was based on qualitative analysis of the morphological complexes in addition 18 morphometric characters of the skull and hyoid bone. Prior to making taxonomic decisions, was conducted a study of geographic, sexual, ontogenetic, and individual variation. Were recognized ten species of Alouatta occuring in Brazil and most of them were defined by discrete, but diagnostic characters. The species are: Alouatta caraya (Humboldt, 1812), A. fusca (Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, 1812), A. clamitans Cabrera, 1940, A. belzebul (Linnaeus, 1766), A. discolor (Spix, 1823), A. ululata Elliot, 1912; A. juara (Linnaeus, 1766), A. macconnelli (Humboldt, 1812), A. puruensis L{\"{o}}nnberg, 1941, and A. nigerrima L{\"{o}}nnberg, 1941. Alouatta macconnelli and A. clamitans showed noticeable geographic variation on pelage coloration and some morphometric characters (polymorphism) difficulting their definition and geographic limits. Alouatta belzebul presented an accentuated geographic mosaic variation on coat coloration. Alouatta ululata and A. puruensis were defined in presenting sexual dicromism on pelage, but this character can be an artefate due the small sample and both taxa need further studies to confirm their validity. Alouatta belzebul mexianae Hagmann, 1908 was sinonimized with A. discolor; and the validity of Alouatta seniculus amazonica L{\"{o}}nnberg 1941 was not considered.},

abstract = {To reduce global biodiversity loss, there is an urgent need to determine the most efficient allocation of conservation resources. Recently, there has been a growing trend for many governments to supplement public ownership and management of reserves with incentive programs for conservation on private land. At the same time, policies to promote conservation on private land are rarely evaluated in terms of their ecological consequences. This raises important questions, such as the extent to which private land conservation can improve conservation outcomes, and how it should be mixed with more traditional public land conservation. We address these questions, using a general framework for modelling environmental policies and a case study examining the conservation of endangered native grasslands to the west of Melbourne, Australia. Specifically, we examine three policies that involve: (i) spending all resources on creating public conservation areas; (ii) spending all resources on an ongoing incentive program where private landholders are paid to manage vegetation on their property with 5-year contracts; and (iii) splitting resources between these two approaches. The performance of each strategy is quantified with a vegetation condition change model that predicts future changes in grassland quality. Of the policies tested, no one policy was always best and policy performance depended on the objectives of those enacting the policy. This work demonstrates a general method for evaluating environmental policies and highlights the utility of a model which combines ecological and socioeconomic processes. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The detection of climate-driven changes in coupled human-natural systems has become a focus of climate research and adaptation efforts around the world. High-resolution gridded historical climate (GHC) products enable analysis of recent climatic changes at the local/regional scales most relevant for research and decision-making, but these fine-scale climate datasets have several caveats. We analyzed two 4 km GHC products to produce high-resolution temperature trend maps for the US Northeast from 1980 to 2009, and compared outputs between products and with an independent climate record. The two products had similar spatial climatologies for mean temperatures, agreed on temporal variability in regionally averaged trends, and agreed that warming has been greater for minimum versus maximum temperatures. Trend maps were highly heterogeneous, i.e., a patchy landscape of warming, cooling and stability that varied by month, but with local-scale anomalies persistent across months (e.g., cooling ‘pockets' within warming zones). In comparing trend maps between GHC products, we found large local-scale disparities at high elevations and along coastlines; and where weather stations were sparse, a single-station disparity in input data resulted in a large zone of trend map disagreement between products. Preliminary cross-validation with an independent climate record indicated substantial and complex errors for both products. Our analysis provided novel landscape-scale insights on climate change in the US Northeast, but raised questions about scale and sources of uncertainty in high-resolution GHC products and differences among the many products available. Given rapid growth in their use, we recommend exercising caution in the analysis and interpretation of high-resolution climate maps.},

abstract = {Integrative studies of plant-animal interactions that incorporate the multiple effects of interactions are important for discerning the importance of each factor within the population dynamics of a plant species. The low regeneration capacity of many Acacia species in arid savannas is a consequence of a combination of reduction in seed dispersal and high seed predation. Here we studied how ungulates (acting as both seed dispersers and herbivores) and bruchid beetles (post-dispersal seed predators) modulate the population dynamics of A. raddiana, a keystone species in the Middle East. We developed two simulation models of plant demography: the first included seed ingestion by ungulates and seed predation by bruchids, whereas the second model additionally incorporated herbivory by ungulates. We also included the interacting effects of seed removal and body mass, because larger ungulates destroy proportionally fewer seeds and enhance seed germination. Simulations showed that the negative effect of seed predation on acacia population size was compensated for by the positive effect of seed ingestion at 50 and 30{\%} seed removal under scenarios with and without herbivory, respectively. Smaller ungulates (e.g., {\textless}35 kg) must necessarily remove tenfold more seeds than larger ungulates (e.g., {\textgreater}250 kg) to compensate for the negative effect of seed predation. Seedling proportion increased with seed removal in the model with herbivory. Managing and restoring acacia seed dispersers is key to conserving acacia populations, because low-to-medium seed removal could quickly restore their regeneration capacity.},

abstract = {The agouti (Dasyprocta punctata) meticulously defleshes Astrocaryum standleyanum palm seeds before scatter hoarding. On Barro Colorado Island, Panama, we experimentally tested three hypotheses on how this behaviour could reduce seed predation to the mutual benefit of the tree and the rodent. The first and established hypothesis – that defleshing reduces seed predation by bruchid beetles by intercepting larvae – was rejected. Experiments in which manually defleshed seeds or entire fruits were incubated at different times showed that defleshing reduced bruchid infestation before fruit fall but not after fruit fall. The second hypothesis – that defleshing reduces cache pilferage by making seeds less conspicuous – was supported. An experiment in which intact fruits and manually defleshed seeds were placed in mimicked agouti caches and followed showed that seeds with flesh were pilfered at higher rates than defleshed seeds. The third hypothesis – that defleshing reduces post-dispersal infestation of cached seeds – was rejected. An experiment in which intact fruits and manually defleshed seeds were placed in mammal exclosures and later collected to assess infestation showed that burial reduced seed infestation but defleshing did not. Thus, seed defleshing reduced palm seed predation, but in a different way than previously believed. We also found that (1) bruchid beetles can be pre-dispersal rather than post-dispersal seed predators, (2) seed infestation by scolytid beetles may control bruchid larvae, and (3) scolytids rather than bruchids are the main invertebrate seed predators of this palm.},

abstract = {The question of 'how many species occur,' whether at a study site, in a park or in a country, is of relevance to the management and conservation of biodiversity. Biodiversity is often equated with species diversity and species richness at a site (Schluter {\&} Ricklefs, 1993; Lande, 1996). Species richness frequently is used as a state variable in evaluating the impact of management interventions or anthropogenic disturbance on biodiversity (Yoccoz, Nichols {\&} Boulinier, 2001). As Tobler et al. (2008) correctly observe, knowledge of the presence and distribution of species is critical to planning and evaluating strategies for conservation of biodiversity. Restricting the scope of their study to inventories of terrestrial forest mammals larger than 1 kg, they discuss the use of automated camera traps to detect forest mammal species, and give an example of how to use an inventory to answer questions about species richness. They conclude with a discussion of issues related to designing species surveys.  The authors used a standard survey design appropriate for estimating jaguar Panthera onca and ocelot Felis pardalis abundance to obtain records of occurrence for all species during two surveys. Using two cameras at each point allowed them to estimate the reliability of the cameras in detecting a species when it passed through the sampling point and to relate the per cent of detections to body mass of the species. They compared eight species richness estimators with a species list for their site, considered to be the 'true' number of species. Finally, they used the frequency of detection to estimate the sampling effort necessary to obtain photographic evidence of rare species at a site. I enjoyed the article and agree with much of it including the idea that a survey designed for one purpose may produce data that are useful for another. I do, however, have several concerns and observations about this study and its inferences.  Detection probabilities in a capture–recapture framework have two components: the probability that an animal (or species) is near a trap site and the conditional probability that an animal is observed, given it is near a trap site. Tobler et al. (2008) attempt to estimate the conditional probability of detection using the per cent of time both cameras photographed an individual. The actual conditional detection probability in this case is the probability that at least one camera detects the animal: },

abstract = {We present a graphic model that explores the effect of distance between parent plants on seed predation and seedling recruitment. Based on the assumption that distance between parents may affect the shape of the seed shadow, the model predicts that seed predators may affect seedling recruitment curves under isolated plants but they are unable to affect these curves under close parent plants. The predictions of the model are tested experimentally in Cryptocarya alba (Lauraceae), a common tree of the Mediterranean forest, Central Chile. Results show that predictions are not met under isolated parent plants. Although seed density decreases significantly away from parent plants, this effect is not relevant for seed predation and seedling recruitment. The biotic/abiotic contrast existing under the canopy vs outside the canopy, plus the shade-tolerance of this tree, better explains the seedling recruitment observed under isolated parent plants. Nevertheless, the predictions of the model are corroborated under close parent plants. Seed shadows overlap to the extent that they generate a homogeneous seed distribution, homogeneous seed predation and homogeneous seedling recruitment as well. We discuss the implications of the model in terms of the spatial pattern of seedlings and the benefits of dispersal from isolated and close parent plants},

Virtually all assessed species are affected by hunting as well as habitat fragmentation and degrada- tion. The populations of only two species are thought to be increasing, while those of at least seven species are in decline. Much work is still needed to ensure the long-term survival of all species. Most armadillo species occur in at least one protected area, but other conservation actions are scarce.},

abstract = {Life-history traits of invasive exotic plants are typically considered to be exceptional vis-{\`{a}}-vis native species. In particular, hyper-fecundity and long range dispersal are regarded as invasive traits, but direct comparisons with native species are needed to identify the life-history stages behind invasiveness. Until recently, this task was particularly problematic in forests as tree fecundity and dispersal were difficult to characterize in closed stands. We used inverse modelling to parameterize fecundity, seed dispersal and seedling dispersion functions for two exotic and eight native tree species in closed-canopy forests in Connecticut, USA. Interannual variation in seed production was dramatic for all species, with complete seed crop failures in at least one year for six native species. However, the average per capita seed production of the exotic Ailanthus altissima was extraordinary: {\textgreater} 40 times higher than the next highest species. Seed production of the shade tolerant exotic Acer platanoides was average, but much higher than the native shade tolerant species, and the density of its established seedlings ({\textgreater}= 3 years) was higher than any other species. Overall, the data supported a model in which adults of native and exotic species must reach a minimum size before seed production occurred. Once reached, the relationship between tree diameter and seed production was fairly flat for seven species, including both exotics. Seed dispersal was highly localized and usually showed a steep decline with increasing distance from parent trees: only Ailanthus altissima and Fraxinus americana had mean dispersal distances ? 10 m. Janzen-Connell patterns were clearly evident for both native and exotic species, as the mode and mean dispersion distance of seedlings were further from potential parent trees than seeds. The comparable intensity of Janzen-Connell effects between native and exotic species suggests that the enemy escape hypothesis alone cannot explain the invasiveness of these exotics. Our study confirms the general importance of colonization processes in invasions, yet demonstrates how invasiveness can occur via divergent colonization strategies. Dispersal limitation of Acer platanoides and recruitment limitation of Ailanthus altissima will likely constitute some limit on their invasiveness in closed-canopy forests.},

abstract = {We used scat analysis to study the diet of two sympatric medium-sized carnivores: brown hyaena and black-backed jackal, in the North West Province of South Africa. Seven major dietary categories were identified from the scats, with mammal remains being most common for both species. Brown hyaena scats contained more large mammal remains, which together with the presence of invertebrates (in 50{\%} of all brown hyaena scats), suggests that they mainly scav- enged. Jackal scats contained a higher proportion of small mammal remains, suggesting that jackals actively hunted more often than brown hyaenas did. The diets differed significantly between the two species, even though diet overlap was fairly high (0.79). Further analysis, albeit based on small sample sizes, suggests that diet of these mesopredators differ between protected reserves with apex predators and unprotected areas without apex predators, thus confounding generalizations. Further studies are therefore required to investigate possible meso- predator release when apex predators are absent. Key words: apex predators, carnivore diets, scat analysis, brown hyaena, black-backed jackal.},

abstract = {The Neotropical otter is a predator located in the upper trophic level; its geographical distribution stretches from northern Mexico to central Argentina. It lives in river banks, where it rests, plays, marks its territory, cleans its fur and breeds its offspring. Lontra longicaudis is sensitive to alterations in the habitat, either by the degradation of river bank environments and by pollution of water bodies; hence, it is considered as an indicator of the degradation of aquatic ecosystems. This species is currently included in the threatened species category according to NOM-059-SEMARNAT-2010. The aim of this work is to characterize the habitat and determine the abundance of the Neotropical otter in the upper part of San Diego River, to assess whether the sea otter population abundance is directly related on the characteristics of the habitat and the seasonal dynamics. The monitoring was carried out over two years (2012-2013). Eight kilometers along the river were sampled considering 3 segments of equal length, since preliminary visits revealed that these had distinctive physical and environmental characteristics. The physicochemical parameters of water were measured, plant species growing along the river bank were identified, 266 samples of feces were collected, and otter relative abundance was estimated. Segment 1 showed an acid water pH, with low temperatures and plant species of the genera Pinus, Quercus and Juniperus along the river banks; the second segment showed a neutral pH, with higher temperatures, and scarce riparian vegetation; the third segment again displayed riparian vegetation, with warm water and near-neutral pH. The relative abundance determined for the otter population averaged 0.46 otters/km. A model for predicting otter abundance was obtained, which yielded a prediction error of ± 0.27 otters/km. The characteristics of the habitat associated with otters in this area were similar to those described by other authors for other parts of the country, namely a neutral pH, clean oxygen-rich waters, low water temperature in the upper portions of the river, presence of riparian vegetation, with stretches of rapids and shallow areas with pools of slow-flowing, deep water. Separately, the abundance of otters found in this case lied within a range that differed from the one reported by other authors, which varies between 0.21 and 1.22 otters/km; again, this was not a fixed value, but varied over the sampling period: it decreased in the rainy season and rose in the dry season. The abundance-habitat relationship model showed an acceptable fit; however, the most significant variables were total dissolved solids, pH, flow zone and depth. This study made possible to determine the current status of the otter and the conditions of its habitat in this area; however, further studies are needed to gain a detailed understanding on the species to support decision-making and implement conservation actions.},

abstract = {Roads with high traffic volumes are a source of animal mortality, can disrupt normal animal movements and dispersal, and may represent a potentially serious threat to wildlife population stability and viability. Retrofitting existing structures built for other purposes (e.g., drainage culverts or small below-grade access roads) to facilitate wildlife crossing by animals and to reduce mortality may be expensive if modifications to the existing structures themselves were involved. However, the environmental context surrounding these structures may influence the willingness of animals to cross, and management of some of these attributes may enhance the attractiveness of these structures. Culverts and underpasses are two common structures along roads in Portugal. We quantified the response of small and medium-sized carnivores to the presence of both types of existing passages by determining: (1) frequency of use; (2) whether use differed by type of passage, and if so; (3) by examining if associated environmental attributes might explain the differences observed. We surveyed 57 different passages along 252 km of highway with a total sampling effort of 2,330 passage trap-days. The mean passage rate for carnivores combined was 0.7 complete passages per crossing structure per day. Crossings by weasel, polecat, otter, and wildcat were infrequent or absent. Red fox, badger, genet and Egyptian mongoose used the crossing structures regularly and without obvious preference; stone marten preferred underpasses. Regression analyses showed the frequency of use by carnivores varied with structural, landscape, road-related features, and human disturbance with 17 of 26 (65{\%}) attributes being significant. Larger passages with vegetation close to the passage entrances, favorable habitat in the surrounding area, and low disturbance by humans were important key features to regular use by the guild of species studied. Mitigation planning in areas with ecological significance for carnivores will be beneficial. Structural attributes and human disturbances are more difficult or expensive to change, even though related significantly to crossing use. Management of vegetation at passage entrances and restricting human use near passages in carnivore suitable areas may substantially improve crossing attractiveness for the guild of carnivore species.},

abstract = {Xenarthrans—anteaters, sloths, and armadillos—have essential functions for ecosystem maintenance, such as insect control and nutrient cycling, playing key roles as ecosystem engineers. Because of habitat loss and fragmentation, hunting pressure, and conflicts with domestic dogs, these species have been threatened locally, regionally, or even across their full distribution ranges. The Neotropics harbor 21 species of armadillos, 10 anteaters, and 6 sloths. Our data set includes the families Chlamyphoridae (13), Dasypodidae (7), Myrmecophagidae (3), Bradypodidae (4), and Megalonychidae (2). We have no occurrence data on Dasypus pilosus (Dasypodidae). Regarding Cyclopedidae, until recently, only one species was recognized, but new genetic studies have revealed that the group is represented by seven species. In this data paper, we compiled a total of 42,528 records of 31 species, represented by occurrence and quantitative data, totaling 24,847 unique georeferenced records. The geographic range is from the southern United States, Mexico, and Caribbean countries at the northern portion of the Neotropics, to the austral distribution in Argentina, Paraguay, Chile, and Uruguay. Regarding anteaters, Myrmecophaga tridactyla has the most records (n = 5,941), and Cyclopes sp. have the fewest (n = 240). The armadillo species with the most data is Dasypus novemcinctus (n = 11,588), and the fewest data are recorded for Calyptophractus retusus (n = 33). With regard to sloth species, Bradypus variegatus has the most records (n = 962), and Bradypus pygmaeus has the fewest (n = 12). Our main objective with Neotropical Xenarthrans is to make occurrence and quantitative data available to facilitate more ecological research, particularly if we integrate the xenarthran data with other data sets of Neotropical Series that will become available very soon (i.e., Neotropical Carnivores, Neotropical Invasive Mammals, and Neotropical Hunters and Dogs). Therefore, studies on trophic cascades, hunting pressure, habitat loss, fragmentation effects, species invasion, and climate change effects will be possible with the Neotropical Xenarthrans data set. Please cite this data paper when using its data in publications. We also request that researchers and teachers inform us of how they are using these data.},

abstract = {Camera traps now represent a reliable, efficient and cost-effective technique to monitor wildlife and collect biological data in the field. However, efficiently extracting information from the massive amount of images generated is often extremely time-consuming and may now represent the most rate-limiting step in camera trap studies.To help overcome this challenge, we developed FoxMask, a new tool performing the automatic detection of animal presence in short sequences of camera trap images. FoxMask uses background estimation and foreground segmentation algorithms to detect the presence of moving objects (most likely, animals) on images.We analyzed a sample dataset from camera traps used to monitor activity on arctic fox Vulpes lagopus dens to test the parameter settings and the performance of the algorithm. The shape and color of arctic foxes, their background at snowmelt and during the summer growing season were highly variable, thus offering challenging testing conditions. We compared the automated animal detection performed by FoxMask to a manual review of the image series.The performance analysis indicated that the proportion of images correctly classified by FoxMask as containing an animal or not was very high ({\textgreater} 90{\%}). FoxMask is thus highly efficient at reducing the workload by eliminating most false triggers (images without an animal). We provide parameter recommendations to facilitate usage and we present the cases where the algorithm performs less efficiently to stimulate further development.FoxMask is an easy-to-use tool freely available to ecologists performing camera trap data extraction. By minimizing analytical time, computer-assisted image analysis will allow collection of increased sample sizes and testing of new biological questions.},

abstract = {Nocturnal arboreal mammals are challenging to study in the wild, especially in dense tropical forests. Camera-trapping is a non-invasive method to study elusive species and is increasingly used to document species presence, habitat use, and density. However traditional camera-flash systems may in fact be “invasive” when used to study animals that completely rely on vision to navigate the rainforest canopy at night. This study demonstrates that using standard flash photography in camera-traps can lead to avoidance behaviour in Kinkajou Potos flavus. Researchers wishing to study nocturnal arboreal mammals should explore infrared techniques when using cam- era-traps in the canopy.},

abstract = {This paper has extended and updated my earlier list and analysis of candidate models used in theoretical modelling and empirical examination of species2013area relationships (SARs). I have also reviewed trivariate models that can be applied to include a second independent variable (in addition to area) and discussed extensively the justifications for fitting curves to SARs and the choice of model. There is also a summary of the characteristics of several new candidate models, especially extended power models, logarithmic models and parameterizations of the negative-exponential family and the logistic family. I have, moreover, examined the characteristics and shapes of trivariate linear, logarithmic and power models, including combination variables and interaction terms. The choice of models according to best fit may conflict with problems of non-normality or heteroscedasticity. The need to compare parameter estimates between data sets should also affect model choice. With few data points and large scatter, models with few parameters are often preferable. With narrow-scale windows, even inflexible models such as the power model and the logarithmic model may produce good fits, whereas with wider-scale windows where inflexible models do not fit well, more flexible models such as the second persistence (P2) model and the cumulative Weibull distribution may be preferable. When extrapolations and expected shapes are important, one should consider models with expected shapes, e.g. the power model for sample area curves and the P2 model for isolate curves. The choice of trivariate models poses special challenges, which one can more effectively evaluate by inspecting graphical plots.},

abstract = {Terrestrial mammals are a key component of tropical forest communities as indicators of ecosystem health and providers of important ecosystem services. However, there is little quantitative information about how they change with local, regional and global threats. In this paper, the first standardized pantropical forest terrestrial mammal community study, we examine several aspects of terrestrial mammal species and community diversity (species richness, species diversity, evenness, dominance, functional diversity and community structure) at seven sites around the globe using a single standardized camera trapping methodology approach. The sites-located in Uganda, Tanzania, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Suriname, Brazil and Costa Rica-are surrounded by different landscape configurations, from continuous forests to highly fragmented forests. We obtained more than 51 000 images and detected 105 species of mammals with a total sampling effort of 12687 camera trap days. We find that mammal communities from highly fragmented sites have lower species richness, species diversity, functional diversity and higher dominance when compared with sites in partially fragmented and continuous forest. We emphasize the importance of standardized camera trapping approaches for obtaining baselines for monitoring forest mammal communities so as to adequately understand the effect of global, regional and local threats and appropriately inform conservation actions.},

abstract = {Climate change over the past approximately 30 years has produced numerous shifts in the distributions and abundances of species and has been implicated in one species-level extinction. Using projections of species' distributions for future climate scenarios, we assess extinction risks for sample regions that cover some 20{\%} of the Earth's terrestrial surface. Exploring three approaches in which the estimated probability of extinction shows a power-law relationship with geographical range size, we predict, on the basis of mid-range climate-warming scenarios for 2050, that 15-37{\%} of species in our sample of regions and taxa will be 'committed to extinction'. When the average of the three methods and two dispersal scenarios is taken, minimal climate-warming scenarios produce lower projections of species committed to extinction ( approximately 18{\%}) than mid-range ( approximately 24{\%}) and maximum-change ( approximately 35{\%}) scenarios. These estimates show the importance of rapid implementation of technologies to decrease greenhouse gas emissions and strategies for carbon sequestration.},

abstract = {Diet and habitat use of jaguar, puma, and ocelot, and populations of their mammalian prey, were studied in an undisturbed rainforest in southeastern Peru. Analysis of scats (feces) showed terrestrial mammals to be the chief prey of all three felids, but reptiles and birds were also numerically important in the diets of ocelot and jaguar. Prey diversity is high and the cats evidently take any readily captured vertebrate. For major terrestrial mammal prey of felids, density, biomass, prey/predator ratios, and annual offtake from the study area are estimated. All three cat species seem to hunt by opportunistic encounter of prey. Most mammalian prey species were taken in about the ratios of occurrence, but peccaries were taken by jaguar more often than expected. Most prey of jaguar have a body weight of {\textgreater}1 kg, those of ocelot, ≤1 kg. Jaguar often used waterside habitats, where they captured caiman and river turtles. Puma did not use these habitats or resources, although the puma prey sample was too small for much inference. The possible effects of felids on study area prey populations are discussed. Large and small cats partition prey at the body weight region where prey switches from low to high reproductive rates. {\textcopyright} 1987 Springer-Verlag.},

Molecular and karyologic data were concordant in demonstrating that Coendou and Sphiggurus represent 2 evolutionary lineages. Comparative analyses showed that species of Coendou are karyotypically conservative, sharing the same diploid and fundamental number, whereas those of the genus Sphiggurus diverge in diploid number despite sharing the same fundamental number. We herein describe the karyotype of Sphiggurus melanura, a species considered a junior synonym of S. insidiosus by some authors. Our karyologic data (2n = 72, fundamental number = 76), however, clearly contradict this hypothesis and suggest that S. melanura is a valid taxon.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to compare the diet of the ocelot at two sites in southeastern Brazil: the small (957 ha), isolated Caratinga Biological Station (CBS), Minas Gerais and the large ({\textgreater}44,000 ha) contiguous area, comprised of the Vale do Rio Doce Natural Reserve (VRDNR) and the Sooretama Biological Reserve (SBR). We collected 60 scats in CBS from January 1997 to July 2000. Small rodents, small marsupials and primates were the most important items in terms of frequency of occurrence. In terms of biomass consumed, the brown howler monkey (Alouatta guariba) was the most important item. In the VRDNR/SBR we collected 77 scats from April 1995 to September 1996 and from January 1999 to September 2000. The main food items were armadillo (Dasypus sp.), small rodents, teju (Tupinambis merianae), and small marsupials. In VRDNR/SBR the ocelot had a more diverse diet, probably reflecting the diversity of prey species found in this area. The occurrence of ocelots in CBS indicates the adaptive flexibility of this felid to forests fragments, probably facilitated by the high biomass of potential prey - in this case, the primate Alouatta guariba},

abstract = {Apex predators have experienced catastrophic declines throughout the world as a result of human persecution and habitat loss. These collapses in top predator populations are commonly associated with dramatic increases in the abundance of smaller predators. Known as “mesopredator release,” this trophic interaction has been recorded across a range of communities and ecosystems. Mesopredator outbreaks often lead to declining prey populations, sometimes destabilizing communities and driving local extinctions. We present an overview of mesopredator release and illustrate how its underlying concepts can be used to improve predator management in an increasingly fragmented world. We also examine shifts in North American carnivore ranges during the past 200 years and show that 60{\%} of mesopredator ranges have expanded, whereas all apex predator ranges have contracted. The need to understand how best to predict and manage mesopredator release is urgent—mesopredator outbreaks are causing high ecological, economic, and social costs around the world.},

abstract = {Animals aid population growth and fitness in tropical forest communities through dispersal and negatively impact populations through seed predation. The interaction between dispersal and seed predation can produce distance- or density-dependence; powerful mechanisms for maintaining species diversity incorporated in the Janzen-Connell model. Large mammals, the highest biomass seed predators of intact Amazonian communities and at risk due to human disturbance, are potentially central to these interactions. This study tests the Janzen-Connell model and investigates the impact of mammalian seed predators on seedling recruitment and maintenance of tree diversity. Patterns of both vertebrate and invertebrate seed predation and seedling recruitment were studied in the two most abundant canopy tree species in western Amazonia (Arecaceae: Astrocaryum murumuru and Iriartea deltoidea). We specifically examined effects of both spatial and temporal variation of the highest biomass seed predator in southwest Amazonian forests, the white-lipped peccary ( Tayassu pecari), on recruitment through disturbed and undisturbed sites and through a fortuitous 12 year natural extinction and recolonization event of T. pecari. Distance-dependent seedling recruitment was found in Astrocaryum and Iriartea at both sites. However, the median distance of seedlings was approximately 1.5x farther from reproductive adults in both palms at the undisturbed site. The number of Iriartea seeds escaping predation increased 6,000{\%} in both space and time due to the decline of T. pecari abundance. The results demonstrate that Janzen-Connell effects are stronger in intact ecosystems and tie these mechanistically to changes in seed predator abundance. This study shows that anthropogenic changes in mammal communities decrease the magnitude of Janzen-Connell effects in Amazonian forests and may result in decreases in tree diversity.},

abstract = {We evaluated the efficacy of placing camera traps at river otter (Lontra canadensis) latrines (discrete sites in riparian areas where otters regularly deposit scats, urine, and anal secretions) to detect other carnivores occupying Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge, New Jersey, USA. We postulated that scents at latrines may serve as an attractant to other carnivores and evaluated this premise by using camera traps to compare carnivore detection rates (overall and by species) and richness (overall and for each survey month) between latrine (n=5) and non-latrine riparian areas (n=5). On average carnivore richness was about 1.7 times higher than that of a non-latrine, and mean richness was higher at latrines for all survey months. Likewise, the overall carnivore detection frequency was 3.5 times greater at latrines, and the detection frequencies for red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), northern raccoons (Procyon lotor), river otters, mink (Neovison vison), long-tailed weasels (Mustela frenata), and Virginia opossums (Didelphis virginiana) were greater at latrines. American black bears (Ursus americanus) and eastern coyotes (Canis latrans) where detected more frequently at non-latrines. Our study provides evidence that placement of camera traps at otter latrines may serve as a new and novel approach for monitoring carnivore populations in riparian areas.},

Monthly, we went by boat along Sa{\'{i}}-Mirim, Bra{\c{c}}o do Norte, and Volta Velha rivers looking for otter holts, scats and footprints. The results obtained indicate that on the studied rivers, characterized by presence of silty and/or sandy bottom and absence of rocks, otters use holts among tree roots, mainly where river banks are high. In this type of environment, dense vegetation protects holt structure against erosion and high banks represent a protection against flooding. The present work corroborates the importance of the alluvial dense ombrophyllous forest to keep habitat conditions favorable to the Neotropical otter.},

abstract = {EASAC – the European Academies Science Advisory Council – is formed by the national science academies of the EU Member States to enable them to collaborate with each other in providing advice to European policy-makers. It thus provides a means for the collective voice of European science to be heard. Its mission reflects the view of academies that science is central to many aspects of modern life and that an appreciation of the scientific dimension is a pre-requisite to wise policy-making. This view already underpins the work of many academies at national level. With the growing importance of the European Union as an arena for policy, academies recognise that the scope of their advisory functions needs to extend beyond the national to cover also the European level. Here it is often the case that a trans-European grouping can be more effective than a body from a single country. The academies of Europe have therefore formed EASAC so that they can speak with a common voice with the goal of building science into policy at EU level. Through EASAC, the academies work together to provide independent, expert, evidence-based advice about the scientific aspects of public policy to those who make or influence policy within the European institutions. Drawing on the memberships and networks of the academies, EASAC accesses the best of European science in carrying out its work. Its views are vigorously independent of commercial or political bias, and it is open and transparent in its processes. EASAC aims to deliver advice that is comprehensible, relevant and timely. EASAC covers all scientific and technical disciplines, and its experts are drawn from all the countries of the European Union. It is funded by the member academies and by contracts with interested bodies. The expert members of project groups give their time free of charge. EASAC has no commercial or business sponsors. EASAC's activities include substantive studies of the scientific aspects of policy issues, reviews and advice about policy documents, workshops aimed at identifying current scientific thinking about major policy issues or at briefing policy- makers, and short, timely statements on topical subjects. The EASAC Council has 26 individual members – highly experienced scientists nominated one each by the national science academies of every EU Member State that has one, the Academia Europaea and ALLEA. It is supported by a professional secretariat based at the Royal Society in London. The Council agrees the initiation of projects, appoints members of project groups, reviews drafts and approves reports for publication.},

abstract = {The Janzen-Connell hypothesis explains the maintenance of tropical diversity through the interacting effects of parent-centered dispersal patterns and distance- and density-dependent propagule survival. These effects were thought to support regular spacing of species within tropical forest, enhancing diversity. One of the predictions of the hypothesis is that seed and seedling survival should improve with increased parental distance. Although there are many independent tests of this hypothesis for individual species, there are few synthetic studies that have brought these data together to test its validity across species. This paper reports the results of a meta-analysis of the effect of distance on enhancing propagule survival, employing an odds-ratio effect size metric. We found no general support for the distance-dependent prediction of the hypothesis, and conclude that further testing to explore this hypothesis as a diversity-maintaining mechanism is unnecessary. However, we did find that distance from parent slightly reduces survivorship in the temperate zone, as contrasted with the tropics, and we saw stronger evidence in support of the hypothesis for seedlings than for seeds. The phenomenon of enhanced propagule survival with distance from the parent may be important for the population biology of particular species, but it is not a general phenomenon across communities, life history stages or life forms.},

Em todo o mundo a retirada da vegeta{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o nativa, para os mais variados tipos de uso da terra, tem atingido n{\'{i}}veis alarmantes. A degrada{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o ambiental {\'{e}} ainda mais acentuada nos tr{\'{o}}picos (Myers, 1988), onde as taxas de desmatamento crescem a uma velocidade assustadora. Para se ter uma id{\'{e}}ia da gravidade desse processo no Brasil, basta citar que de cada 10 {\'{a}}rvores que tombam no mundo uma est{\'{a}} na Floresta Amaz{\^{o}}nica. Segundo dados do Minist{\'{e}}rio do Meio Ambiente (MMA, 1998), entre 1978 e 1994 a {\'{a}}rea desmatada nessa regi{\~{a}}o passou de 78.000 km 2 para 470.000 km 2 , o que equivale a 12{\%} da {\'{a}}rea original sendo cortada em apenas 16 anos. Mas n{\~{a}}o {\'{e}} na Amaz{\^{o}}nia que a destrui{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o atingiu o seu m{\'{a}}ximo: no cerrado e na caatinga cerca de 40{\%} a 50 {\%} da vegeta{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o original j{\'{a}} foi desmatada (MMA, 1998) e estima-se que da Mata Atl{\^{a}}ntica restem apenas cerca de 5{\%} da cobertura vegetal original (Fonseca, 1985; Dean, 1996). Todos os tipos de vegeta{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o citados, assim como os de outras paisagens exploradas no mundo, t{\^{e}}m em comum o fato de j{\'{a}} terem formado {\'{a}}reas cont{\'{i}}nuas. Ao longo do tempo esses habitats foram progressivamente transformados em pequenos peda{\c{c}}os remanescentes, isolados uns dos outros e mergulhados em paisagens em mosaico alteradas pelo homem. Este processo, conhecido como fragmenta{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de habitats (lato sensu), {\'{e}} considerado atualmente uma das maiores amea{\c{c}}as {\`{a}} biodiversidade global. {\'{E}} {\'{u}}til dividir conceitualmente a fragmenta{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o lato sensu em dois processos distintos (como faz Fahrig, 2003): redu{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o da {\'{a}}rea total de habitat e fragmenta{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o sensu stricto; este segundo processo tem a ver com a divis{\~{a}}o do habitat (breaking apart the habitat, Fahrig, 2003), independentemente da perda da {\'{a}}rea. Embora os dois processos interajam e a separa{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o dos dois seja um tanto arbitr{\'{a}}ria, trat{\'{a}}-los como dois fen{\^{o}}menos distintos tem grande valor did{\'{a}}tico e heur{\'{i}}stico. De fato, a redu{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o na biodiversidade local acontece em duas escalas de tempo diferentes: a curto prazo, atrav{\'{e}}s da perda da {\'{a}}rea, ou a longo prazo, atrav{\'{e}}s dos efeitos da insulariza{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o, que, por sua vez, dependem da conforma{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o da paisagem (Wilcox, 1980; Fernandez, 1997). No primeiro processo, a perda de habitat pode excluir imediatamente algumas esp{\'{e}}cies se as mesmas forem raras ou estiverem distribu{\'{i}}das em manchas, al{\'{e}}m disso, os pequenos tamanhos populacionais das esp{\'{e}}cies remanescentes aumentam sua probabilidade de extin{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o por uma s{\'{e}}rie de motivos que ser{\~{a}}o vistos adiante. J{\'{a}} o isolamento pode diminuir ou mesmo eliminar a coloniza{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o por esp{\'{e}}cies presentes em {\'{a}}reas vizinhas, assim como o fluxo g{\^{e}}nico, al{\'{e}}m de impedir que as esp{\'{e}}cies tenham acesso aos recursos localizados fora da mancha de habitat (Shafer, 1990). Sendo assim, o tamanho de cada {\'{a}}rea remanescente, o tempo de isolamento e o grau de conectividade entre elas (que inclui a dist{\^{a}}ncia entre {\'{a}}reas remanescentes e o tipo de ambiente que as envolve) est{\~{a}}o entre os principais fatores que influenciam a resposta a longo prazo das esp{\'{e}}cies {\`{a}} fragmenta{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o. Nos {\'{u}}ltimos anos, os resultados de uma s{\'{e}}rie de estudos sobre os efeitos da fragmenta{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o come{\c{c}}aram a surgir, deixando claro que n{\~{a}}o {\'{e}} mais poss{\'{i}}vel ter a ilus{\~{a}}o de que fragmentos possam ser pequenas r{\'{e}}plicas completas do habitat original. A documenta{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o sobre a perda de esp{\'{e}}cies animais em remanescentes florestais cresce a cada ano (Lovejoy et al., 1986; Wilcove et al. Bierregaard et al., 2001; Fahrig, 2003), de forma que o entendimento de como cada esp{\'{e}}cie vai ser afetada por esse processo torna-se essencial para que novas perdas possam ser evitadas. O primeiro passo, portanto, {\'{e}} entender como o processo de fragmenta{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o p{\~{o}}e em risco a persist{\^{e}}ncia dessas esp{\'{e}}cies.},

abstract = {Aim Comparative studies have revealed strong links between ecological factors and the number of parasite species harboured by different hosts, but studies of different taxonomic host groups have produced inconsistent results. As a step towards understanding the general patterns of parasite species richness, we present results from a new comprehensive data base of over 7000 host-parasite combinations representing 146 species of carnivores (Mammalia: Carnivora) and 980 species of parasites. Methods We used both phylogenetic and non-phylogenetic comparative methods while controlling for unequal sampling effort within a multivariate framework to ascertain the main determinants of parasite species richness in carnivores. Results We found that body mass, population density, geographical range size and distance from the equator are correlated with overall parasite species richness in fissiped carnivores. When parasites are classified by transmission mode, body mass and home range area are the main determinants of the richness of parasites spread by close contact between hosts, and population density, geographical range size and distance from the equator account for the diversity of parasites that are not dependent on close contact. For generalist parasites, population density, geographical range size and latitude are the primary predictors of parasite species richness. We found no significant ecological correlates for the richness of specialist or vector-borne parasites. Main conclusions Although we found that parasite species richness increases instead of decreases with distance from the equator, other comparative patterns in carnivores support previous findings in primates, suggesting that similar ecological factors operate in both these independent evolutionary lineages.},

abstract = {The uncertainty or the provisional status of a taxonomic identification can be expressed by a set of terms and abbreviations known as Open Nomenclature (ON) qualifiers. This approach is widely applied across biological disciplines, and a high amount of biodiversity data left in ON can be found in literature and data bases. However, there is no consensus about ON qualifiers and their meaning. The use of ON qualifiers has been reviewed in order to provide a summary and guide to current practice in zoology. Some recommendation is given to avoid inconsistencies or vagueness. A flow chart is proposed to clarify the sources of uncertainties during identification and to facilitate the application of ON qualifiers. This review provides a guide for taxonomists and ecologists currently involved in biomonitoring and biodiversity programmes, as well as for researchers dealing with biodiversity data infrastructures and tools, offering a starting point for a methodological harmonization.},

A total of 46 carcasses of at least 12 vertebrate species killed by dogs were found along 44 months in an urban, 250 ha Atlantic forest fragment in southeastern Brazil. Feral dogs showed no apparent selection towards different species of prey, killing from small frogs to deer. Mammals were the most frequent prey found (75{\%}). Our data indicate that feral dogs have a great impact on wildlife in the Atlantic forest, especially in areas where wildlife needs to move between forest fragments.

abstract = {Aim|Numerous functions have been proposed to describe the species-area relationship but despite almost a century of curve-fitting there is little agreement on which is best. We aimed to rationalize the list of proposed functions and to discuss appropriate methodology for fitting and comparing the alternatives.|Location|Data from the British Isles were used for model comparisons.|Methods|Sixteen functions that have been proposed as models of the species-area relationship were compared algebraically and reformulated into a consistent format. Each was parameterized to enable their use as link functions to model the combined effects of area and other factors (covariates) on S (species number). Using data on the number of plant species on 41 British islands, we examined the effects of ignoring important covariates on the choice of the best-fitting function. The methods used in some recent studies that compared alternative functions were examined.|Results|Many of the 16 species-area functions are special cases of others, some are identical, and two arose as a result of transcription errors. The 16 functions were reduced to a set of nine general functions. The empirical comparison showed that including covariates in addition to area resulted in a different best-fitting function, and that different functions identified different covariates as important. Previous studies that have compared alternative functions suffered from three shortcomings: (1) too much emphasis was placed on maximizing goodness-of-fit between S and A (area), ignoring the effects of other factors, (2) most made implicit or untested assumptions about the distribution of S, and (3) some repeated the mispractice of using R2 to compare models with different numbers of parameters or differing error distributions.|Main conclusions|The generalized linear model is a framework with which to fit alternative species-area functions, and the information-theoretic approach provides one suitable method with which to compare their fit. Ignoring the effects of important covariates may result in an incorrect choice of the best-fitting function. The choice of function may also affect which covariates are found to be important. Determining an appropriate statistical model with which to relate species number to area and other covariates requires careful consideration of many issues, not just of the functional relationship between species number and area.},

abstract = {Seed dispersal by animals is a complex process involving several distinct stages: fruit removal by frugivores, seed delivery in different microhabitats, seed germination, seedling establishment, and adult recruitment. Nevertheless, studies conducted until now have provided scarce information concerning the sequence of stages in a plant's life cycle in its entirety. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the immediate consequences of frugivore activity for Eugenia umbelliflora (Myrtaceae) early recruitment by measuring the relative importance of each fruit-eating bird species on the establishment of new seedlings in scrub and low restinga vegetation in the Atlantic rainforest, Brazil.We conducted focal tree observations on E. umbelliflora trees recording birds' feeding behaviour and post-feeding movements.We also recorded the fate of dispersed seeds in scrub and low restinga vegetation.We recorded 17 bird species interacting with fruits in 55 h of observation. Only 30{\%} of the handled fruits were successfully removed. From 108 post flight movements of exit from the fruiting trees, 30.6{\%} were to scrub and 69.4{\%} to low restinga forest. Proportion of seed germination was higher in low restinga than in the scrub vegetation. Incorporating the probabilities of seeds' removal, deposition, and germination in both sites, we found that the relative importance of each frugivorous bird as seed dispersers varies largely among species. Turdus amaurochalinus and Turdus rufiventris were the best dispersers, together representing almost 12{\%} probability of seed germination following removal. Our results show the importance of assessing the overall consequence of seed dispersal within the framework of disperser effectiveness, providing a more comprehensive and realistic evaluation of the relative importance of different seed dispersers on plant population dynamics.},

abstract = {Several plant characteristics, such as fruit production, nutrient reward, secondary compounds, and fruit color display, affect fruit choice by birds. On the other hand, several bird attributes affect their efficiency as dispersers. Here we investigate the ornithochoric seed dispersal of Pera glabrata Schott (Euphorbiaceae) in a cerrado fragment in southeastern Brazil. A set of bird attributes, such as frequency of visits, number of diaspores eaten, time spent foraging, methods of taking and handling the diaspores and agonistic interactions were analyzed in order to infer about the potential of each species to act as a seed disperser. Birds were the unique seed dispersers of these oil-rich diaspores. We observed 414 bird visits during 60 hours of focal observations in five trees from December 1999 to January 2000. Twenty bird species from seven families ate the diaspores of P. glabrata, but only 14 species were considered potential seed dispersers because they swallowed the diaspores, increasing the probabilities for the seeds to be defecated and/or regurgitated away from the parent trees. The main potential seed dispersers were: Turdus leucomelas (Muscicapidae), Dacnis cayana (Emberizidae), Colaptes melanochloros (Picidae) and Elaenia spp. (Tyrannidae). We did not find any significant seasonal change in the number of visits on the fruiting trees throughout the day. We also did not find any relation between the number of visits per tree and fruit production. The most effective seed dispersers of P. glabrata were generalist birds, which have a high visiting rate, high fruit consumption rate, and spend short periods on the plants. The large number of species recorded as potential seed dispersers of P. glabrata, being most of them very abundant even in Brazilian disturbed areas, may guarantee seed dispersal of this plant in small fragments and regenerating areas.},

abstract = {We found that trends in the rate of description of 580,000 marine and terrestrial species, in the taxonomically authoritative World Register of Marine Species and Catalogue of Life databases, were similar until the 1950s. Since then, the relative number of marine to terrestrial species described per year has increased, reflecting the less explored nature of the oceans. From the mid-19th century, the cumulative number of species described has been linear, with the highest number of species described in the decade of 1900, and fewer species described and fewer authors active during the World Wars. There were more authors describing species since the 1960s, indicating greater taxonomic effort. There were fewer species described per author since the 1920s, suggesting it has become more difficult to discover new species. There was no evidence of any change in individual effort by taxonomists. Using a nonhomogeneous renewal process model we predicted that 24-31{\%} to 21-29{\%} more marine and terrestrial species remain to be discovered, respectively. We discuss why we consider that marine species comprise only 16{\%} of all species on Earth although the oceans contain a greater phylogenetic diversity than occurs on land. We predict that there may be 1.8-2.0 million species on Earth, of which about 0.3 million are marine, significantly less than some previous estimates.},

The primary data generated by these inventories comprise one of the most important steps in decisions making regarding the management of natural areas. However, several problems have been observed at different levels related to inventories of fauna in Brazil, and range from the training of humans to the lack of standardization of experimental design and selection of inappropriate methods. We present case studies of mammals, reptiles, amphibians and fishes, where they discussed issues such temporal variability and methods for detection of terrestrial fauna, suggesting that both inventories and monitoring programs should be extended for longer terms and that inventories should include different methodologies to ensure that their goals are fully achieved.},

abstract = {Em decorr{\^{e}}ncia de sua vis{\~{a}}o adaptada apenas {\`{a}} luz do dia, os humanos primitivos desenvolveram um temor e um respeito at{\'{a}}vicos pelas trevas noturnas, extensivos aos seres que s{\~{a}}o ativos nelas. Assim, se desenvolveram mitos e fantasias sobre a coruja, o sapo, as grandes mariposas (tamb{\'{e}}m conhecidas como bruxas) e o morcego, entre outros tipos de animais. Tais fantasias atravessaram os tempos e, na Europa, por exemplo, deram origem a lendas sobre seres meio humanos meio dem{\^{o}}nios como as bruxas, o lobisomem e o vampiro. Tratados no singular, como se fossem esp{\'{e}}cies {\'{u}}nicas, esses animais passaram a ser temidos porque, al{\'{e}}m de serem “feios”, seriam “nocivos”: a coruja por seu mau agouro, o sapo por ter verrugas e espirrar leite venenoso nos olhos das pessoas, as mariposas por seu p{\'{o}} capaz de cegar e os morcegos por serem todos capazes de sugar o sangue dos humanos. J{\'{a}} no s{\'{e}}culo XVII, o naturalista Guilherme Piso, tratando da flora e fauna brasileiras, relatava que a mordida do “andir{\'{a}}” (morcego) era da mesma natureza que a pe{\c{c}}onha do c{\~{a}}o raivoso. Felizmente, por seus h{\'{a}}bitos cr{\'{i}}pticos e por serem ativos em per{\'{i}}odo do dia diferente daquele da maioria dos humanos, esses animais, que n{\~{a}}o s{\~{a}}o formas {\'{u}}nicas (s{\'{o}} de morcegos voam no Brasil ao menos 167 esp{\'{e}}cies distintas), est{\~{a}}o relativamente protegidos de sua extin{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o.

abstract = {Key risks associated with projected climate trends for the 21st century include the prospects of future climate states with no current analog and the disappearance of some extant climates. Because climate is a primary control on species distributions and ecosystem processes, novel 21st-century climates may promote formation of novel species associations and other ecological surprises, whereas the disappearance of some extant climates increases risk of extinction for species with narrow geographic or climatic distributions and disruption of existing communities. Here we analyze multimodel ensembles for the A2 and B1 emission scenarios produced for the fourth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, with the goal of identifying regions projected to experience (i) high magnitudes of local climate change, (ii) development of novel 21st-century climates, and/or (iii) the disappearance of extant climates. Novel climates are projected to develop primarily in the tropics and subtropics, whereas disappearing climates are concentrated in tropical montane regions and the poleward portions of continents. Under the high-end A2 scenario, 12-39{\%} and 10-48{\%} of the Earth's terrestrial surface may respectively experience novel and disappearing climates by 2100 AD. Corresponding projections for the low-end B1 scenario are 4-20{\%} and 4-20{\%}. Dispersal limitations increase the risk that species will experience the loss of extant climates or the occurrence of novel climates. There is a close correspondence between regions with globally disappearing climates and previously identified biodiversity hotspots; for these regions, standard conservation solutions (e.g., assisted migration and networked reserves) may be insufficient to preserve biodiversity.},

abstract = {1.Camera trapping is a widely applied method to study mammalian biodiversity and is still gaining popularity. It can quickly generate large amounts of data which need to be managed in an efficient and transparent way that links data acquisition with analytical tools. 2.We describe the free and open source R package camtrapR, a new toolbox for flexible and efficient management of data generated in camera trap based wildlife studies. The package implements a complete workflow for processing camera trapping data. It assists in image organisation, species and individual identification, data extraction from images, tabulation and visualisation of results and export of data for subsequent analyses. There is no limitation to the number of images stored in this data management system; the system is portable and compatible across operating systems. 3.The functions provide extensive automation to minimise data entry mistakes and, apart from species and individual identification, require minimal manual user input. Species and individual identification are performed outside the R environment, either via tags assigned in dedicated image management software or by moving images into species directories. 3.Input for occupancy and (spatial) capture-recapture analyses for density and abundance estimation, e.g. in the R packages unmarked or secr, is computed in a flexible and reproducible manner. In addition, survey summary reports can be generated, spatial distributions of records can be plotted and exported to GIS software, and single and two-species activity patterns can be visualised. 4.camtrapR allows for streamlined and flexible camera trap data management and should be most useful to researchers and practitioners who regularly handle large amounts of camera trapping data.

abstract = {Limitations imposed on species ranges by the climatic, ecological, and physiological effects of elevation are important determinants of extinction risk. We modeled the effects of elevational limits on the extinction risk of landbirds, 87{\%} of all bird species. Elevational limitation of range size explained 97{\%} of the variation in the probability of being in a World Conservation Union category of extinction risk. Our model that combined elevational ranges, four Millennium Assessment habitat-loss scenarios, and an intermediate estimate of surface warming of 2.8 degrees C, projected a best guess of 400-550 landbird extinctions, and that approximately 2150 additional species would be at risk of extinction by 2100. For Western Hemisphere landbirds, intermediate extinction estimates based on climate-induced changes in actual distributions ranged from 1.3{\%} (1.1 degrees C warming) to 30.0{\%} (6.4 degrees C warming) of these species. Worldwide, every degree of warming projected a nonlinear increase in bird extinctions of about 100-500 species. Only 21{\%} of the species predicted to become extinct in our scenarios are currently considered threatened with extinction. Different habitat-loss and surface-warming scenarios predicted substantially different futures for landbird species. To improve the precision of climate-induced extinction estimates, there is an urgent need for high-resolution measurements of shifts in the elevational ranges of species. Given the accelerating influence of climate change on species distributions and conservation, using elevational limits in a tested, standardized, and robust manner can improve conservation assessments of terrestrial species and will help identify species that are most vulnerable to global climate change. Our climate-induced extinction estimates are broadly similar to those of bird species at risk from other factors, but these estimates largely involve different sets of species.},

Large mammals were among the most vulnerable to hunting, loss of habitat, and wildlife trade. In the State of Rio de Janeiro there are only two Federal Biological Reserves of lowland Atlantic Rain Forest, the Po{\c{c}}o das Antas Biological Reserve and the Uni{\~{a}}o Biological Reserve. The purpose of this study was to assess the presence and putative influence of illegal hunting on the mammals in these two Conservation Units. Surveys were conducted using a line-transect method; 375 kilometers were covered during the period between December 2003 and January 2005. The data for the population density estimate was analyzed using the program DISTANCE 5.0. Twelve species were confirmed through visual encounters during the surveys, whereas are regularly hunted in the region studied. The species that presented higher density were brown capuchin monkey (Cebus nigritus Erxleben, 1777), howler monkey (Alouatta guariba Lac{\'{e}}p{\`{e}}de, 1799), ninebanded long-nosed armadillo (Dasypus novemcintus Linnaeus, 1758), and the seven-banded long-nosed armadillo (Dasypus septemcinctus Linnaeus, 1758). The most rare or absent species were the brazilian tapir (Tapirus terrestris Br{\"{u}}nnich, 1771), the red brocket deer (Mazama americana Rafinesque, 1817) and the white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari Link, 1795). In these two study areas both direct and indirect evidence of illegal hunting was observed, indicating that hunting is a common practice inside these Biological Reserves. The long-term survival of the hunted species is questionable, because the remaining populations living in fragments that are small and isolated, making them more susceptible to extinction even under low hunting pressure A Mata Atl{\^{a}}ntica, apesar de ainda sofrer uma intensa devasta{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o, abriga 261 esp{\'{e}}cies de mam{\'{i}}feros, sendo 73 end{\^{e}}micos.

abstract = {The distribution of Cape clawless otters, Aonyx capensis, in South Africa and their habitat requirements in freshwater and marine systems has been well established. There is, however, a lack of information on how otters are adapting to urban development and the transformation of critical freshwater habitat. Within the Western Cape, the Cape Peninsula exhibits substantial variation in levels of human impact over a small geographic range, offering an excellent opportunity to explore the hypothesis that otters are adversely affected by habitat transformation. A single season occupancy model was used based on otter sign to determine the probability of otter occupancy across a gradient of habitat transformation at both landscape and local scales. The probability of otters occupying river habitat in the Cape Peninsula was low (P = 0.29) but increased with proximity to marine protected areas (MPAs) that included estuaries and wetland habitat. Otter presence was not influenced by proximity to urban areas at the landscape scale, but declined in canalized sections of river that were heavily degraded by human activity. Despite being heavily transformed, lowland aquatic ecosystems may still provide critical resources in the form of fresh water and breeding sites, and together with food within the marine habitat may be sustaining the peninsula's otter population. In order for otters to persist on the peninsula, conservation authorities must maintain wetland, estuarine and river habitat in close proximity to MPAs. Further research is needed to determine the long-term impacts on otters persisting in degraded ecosystems. Annual single season occupancy surveys provide a rapid, cost-effective method for monitoring changes in otter occupancy which should be incorporated into current monitoring efforts to provide much needed long-term monitoring of a top predator in freshwater ecosystems.},

abstract = {Drainage culverts are known to be used by a diverse number of species. To date, most studies looking at culvert usage have been restricted to the dry season. This seasonal bias has limited our understanding of how different species respond to culverts and, consequently, our ability to find effective ways to promote the use of culverts as aids to species movement. The main goal of this study was to examine the role of highway culverts for mesocarnivores throughout the year. We addressed (1) the seasonality of culvert use, (2) the relative importance of culvert structure, highway features, and surrounding landscape on culvert use, (3) the influence of the water depth and cover on culvert use, and (4) the effect of culvert structure on individual behavior. Fifteen culverts were monitored along 2 highways in southern Portugal using video-surveillance cameras and marble dust for 10 consecutive days per season. We used generalized linear mixed models to determine which factors most affected the culvert use and behavior by mesocarnivores. Our results highlight the effect of seasonality and water on culvert use. Culvert use was positively related with species activity throughout the year. All species (except otters (Lutra lutra)) were less likely to use culverts that contained water more than 3 cm deep or covering more than 70 {\%} of the culvert base. Based on our results, future surveys and culvert retrofit design should address (1) the importance of seasonality in the interpretation of results and (2) the complementarity of culvert-specific features (water, ledges, and naturalization).},

abstract = {Many hypotheses have been proposed to explain high species diversity in Amazonia, but few generalizations have emerged. In part, this has arisen from the scarcity of rigorous tests for mechanisms promoting speciation, and from major uncertainties about palaeogeographic events and their spatial and temporal associations with diversification. Here, we investigate the environmental history of Amazonia using a phylogenetic and biogeographic analysis of trumpeters (Aves: Psophia), which are represented by species in each of the vertebrate areas of endemism. Their relationships reveal an unforeseen {\^{a}}€˜complete{\^{a}}€™ time-slice of Amazonian diversification over the past 3.0 Myr. We employ this temporally calibrated phylogeny to test competing palaeogeographic hypotheses. Our results are consistent with the establishment of the current Amazonian drainage system at approximately 3.0{\^{a}}€“2.0 Ma and predict the temporal pattern of major river formation over Plio-Pleistocene times. We propose a palaeobiogeographic model for the last 3.0 Myr of Amazonian history that has implications for understanding patterns of endemism, the temporal history of Amazonian diversification and mechanisms promoting speciation. The history of Psophia, in combination with new geological evidence, provides the strongest direct evidence supporting a role for river dynamics in Amazonian diversification, and the absence of such a role for glacial climate cycles and refugia.},

abstract = {Recent evidence strongly suggests that biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation continue. How might a systems approach to ecology help us better understand and address these issues? Systems approaches play a very limited role in the science that underpins traditional biodiversity conservation, but could provide important insights into mechanisms that affect population growth. This potential is illustrated using data from a critically endangered bird population. Although species-specific insights have practical value, the main applied challenge for a systems approach is to help improve our understanding of the role of biodiversity in the context of ecosystem services (ES) and the associated values and benefits people derive from these services. This has profound implications for the way we conceptualize and address ecological problems. Instead of focusing directly on biodiversity, the important response variables become measures of values and benefits, ES or ecosystem processes. We then need to understand the sensitivity of these variables to biodiversity change relative to other abiotic or anthropogenic factors, which includes exploring the role of variability at different levels of biological organization. These issues are discussed using the recent UK National Ecosystems Assessment as a framework.},

abstract = {Cabassous comprises armadillos lacking a full osteoderm cover in the tail, justifying its common name naked-tailed armadillos. In the only taxonomic revision of the genus, in 1980, four living species were recognized, including a polytypic taxon with two subspecies. Recent studies have questioned this classification, but a comprehensive taxonomic review is lacking. Here, we revise the taxonomy of the genus Cabassous using complementary morphological approaches and clarify the geographical limits of naked-tailed armadillo species. Based on qualitative and quantitative analyses, we recognize five living species: C. centralis, C. chacoensis, C. squamicaudis, C. unicinctus, and C. tatouay. Most of the species can be easily differentiated using external or cranial traits, except C. centralis and C. unicinctus, which share several morphological features. The scutes pattern on the cephalic shield is an important diagnostic feature in naked-tailed armadillos and can be easily applied in field studies. Cabassous squamicaudis and C. unicinctus were previously treated as subspecies but we show they have conspicuous diagnostic traits, without mixture of characters even in closer contact. Cabassous species can be classified as open-dwellers (C. chacoensis and C. squamicaudis), forest-dwellers (C. centralis and C. unicinctus), or of more generalist habits (C. tatouay). We designate a lectotype for C. unicinctus to preserve its long-term nomenclature use.},

abstract = {Agricultural intensification negatively affects farmland biodiversity, and thereby, ecosystem services such as predation of weed seeds. Landscape complexity (large and diverse areas of semi-natural habitats) and organic farming (without pesticides and mineral fertilizers) can counteract this negative trend, but little is known about their relative importance. We experimentally studied seed removal of four economically relevant weed species by excluding (i) vertebrates, (ii) vertebrates plus large invertebrates and (iii) neither vertebrates nor invertebrates (control) at the field edge and in the interior of 22 organically or conventionally managed winter wheat fields, located across a gradient of landscape complexity (41-94{\%} arable land). Arable land ({\%}) was used as a simple predictor of landscape complexity, as it is closely related to landscape parameters such as habitat type diversity. Seed predation and removal were mainly influenced by large invertebrates, seed species identity, with Cirsium arvense being more affected than Poa trivialis, Apera spica-venti and Galium aparine and landscape complexity in interaction with farming practice, as it increased in conventional fields, but decreased in organic fields as landscape complexity decreased. Seed predation and removal did not consistently correspond to seed predator densities, as small mammal abundances decreased in conventional fields, but increased in organic fields as landscape complexity decreased and carabid activity densities were higher in organic compared to conventional fields. Slug activity density showed same response to landscape complexity and farming practice like seed removal and appeared to additionally influence the movement of seeds. In conclusion, our assessment of interacting local and landscape effect adds to the current knowledge of seed predation and removal. Farming practice and landscape complexity affect seed predator species differentially, thereby resulting in complex pattern of seed predation and removal. The service of weed seed predation is provided by small mammals and invertebrates and the disservice of seed dispersal and movement is provided by slugs. ?? 2011 Perspectives in Plant Ecology, Evolution and Systematics.},

abstract = {Species richness is an important characteristic of ecological communities, but it is difficult to quantify. We report here a thorough inventory of a tropical rain forest ant fauna and use it to evaluate species richness estimators. The study was carried out in ;1500 ha of lowland rain forest at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. Diverse methods were used, including canopy fogging, Malaise traps, Berlese samples, Winkler samples, baiting, and manual search. Workers of 437 ant species were encountered. The abundance distribution was clearly lognormal, and the distribution emerged from a veil line with each doubling of sampling effort. Three richness estimates were calculated: the area under the fitted lognormal distribution, the asymptote of the Michaelis-Menten equation fit to the species accumulation curve, and the Incidence-based Coverage Estimator (ICE). The performance of the estimators was evaluated with sample-based rarefaction plots. The inventory was nearly complete because the species accumulation curve approached an asymptote, the richness estimates were very close to the observed species richness, and the uniques and duplicates curves were both declining. None of the richness estimators was stable in samplebased rarefaction plots, but regions of stability of estimators occurred. The explanation of rarity is one key to understanding why richness estimates fail. Fifty-one species (12{\%} of the total) were still uniques (known from only one sample) at the end of the inventory. The rarity of 20 of these species was explained by ‘‘edge effects'': ‘‘methodological edge species'' (possibly abundant at the site but difficult to sample because of their microhabitat), and ‘‘geographic edge species,'' known to be common in habitats or regions outside of La Selva. Rarity of 31 species remained unexplained. Most of the 51 rare species were known from additional collections outside of La Selva, either in other parts of Costa Rica or in other countries. Only six species were ‘‘global uniques,'' known to date from only one sample on Earth. The study demonstrates that patterns of species occurrence early in an inventory may be inadequate to estimate species richness, but that relatively complete inventories of species-rich arthropod communities are possible if multiple sampling methods and extensive effort are applied. Key words: abundance distribution; ants; biodiversity; Costa Rica; Formicidae; incidence-based coverage estimator; inventories, species; La Selva; lognormal; Michaelis-Menten; richness estimation; species accumulation curves; tropical rain forest.},

abstract = {Tapirs are one of the last extant megafauna species that survived the Pleistocene extinctions. Given their size and digestive system characteristics, tapirs might be the last potential seed disperser of plant species that were previously dispersed by other large mammal species that are now extinct. We compiled evidence from 39 published scientific studies showing that tapirs have a key role as seed dispersers and seed predators. Tapirs play an important role either through seed predation or by facilitating the recruitment of seeds over long distances, therefore influencing the diversity of plant species in the ecosystem. Neotropical tapirs might have a unique role as long-distance seed dispersers of large seeds ({\textless}20 mm) because they are capable of depositing viable large seeds in favorable places for germination that even large-bodied primates cannot disperse. Given the high diversity of seed species found in tapir diet, more information is needed on the identification of seed traits that allow the survival of seeds in the tapir's gut. Moreover, further studies are necessary on the role of tapirs as seed dispersers and predators; in particular considering spatial patterns of dispersed seeds, seed viability, effect of dung, and seed density in tapir latrines, and the effect of deposition sites on germination and seedling survival. Because all tapir species are highly threatened, it is paramount to identify gaps in our knowledge on the ecological role of tapirs and, in particular, on critical and endangered plant-tapir interactions to avoid possible trophic cascading effects on ecosystem function.},

abstract = {It is almost certainly the case that many populations have always existed as metapopulations, leading to the conclusion that local extinctions are common and normally balanced by migrations. This conclusion has major consequences for biodiversity conservation in fragmented tropical forests and the agricultural matrices in which they are embedded. Here we make the argument that the conservation paradigm that focuses on setting aside pristine forests while ignoring the agricultural landscape is a failed strategy in light of what is now conventional wisdom in ecology. Given the fragmented nature of most tropical ecosystems, agricultural landscapes should be an essential component of any conservation strategy. We review the literature on biodiversity in tropical agricultural landscapes and present evidence that many tropical agricultural systems have high levels of biodiversity (planned and associated). These systems represent, not only habitat for biodiversity, but also a high-quality matrix that permits the movement of forest organisms among patches of natural vegetation. We review a variety of agroecosystem types and conclude that diverse, low-input systems using agroecological principles are probably the best option for a high-quality matrix. Such systems are most likely to be constructed by small farmers with land titles, who, in turn, are normally the consequence of grassroots social movements. Therefore, the new conservation paradigm should incorporate a landscape approach in which small farmers, through their social organizations, work with conservationists to create a landscape matrix dominated by productive agroecological systems that facilitate interpatch migration while promoting a sustainable and dignified livelihood for rural communities.},

abstract = {We present an analysis of the long-term survival of two cohorts of seedlings of the tropical canopy tree Ocotea whitei (Lauraceae) on a 1-ha plot of mature, lowland moist forest on Barro Colorado Island, Panam{\'{a}}. In 1980, we counted an even-aged cohort of seedlings that germinated in 1979, then measured and tagged survivors in 1981. We also measured and tagged a second, smaller cohort of seedlings that germinated in 1981. We followed the subsequent survival of all seedlings through 1985. Seedling mortality was phenotypically, temporally, and spatially non-random. Important correlates of non-random mortality included: (1) seedling size and age, (2) an El Ni{\~{n}}o drought, and (3) biotic neighborhood. Larger and older seedlings survived better than smaller and younger seedlings, respectively, and the El Ni{\~{n}}o-related drought of 1982-1983 was associated with elevated mortality rates. Seedling density, which was strongly correlated with the proximity to the nearest conspecific adult, increased mortality. The observed mortality patterns suggest that processes consistent with the Janzen-Connell hypothesis operate during the recruitment phase of O. whitei population dynamics. However, the processes causing the observed density- and distance-dependent mortality may vary with factors such as total seed number, seedling size, and climatic variation, making it difficult to determine whether time-integrated seedling-to-adult spacing mechanisms other than self-thinning operate on a given plant population. After 6 years in the hectare studied, survivors remained densest and most numerous underneath the adult trees. We conclude that only long-term demographic data, collected at a variety of scales on a variety of species, will ultimately answer the question: do Janzen-Connell effects contribute substantially to structuring tropical forests?},

abstract = {Populational parameters of primates in the remaining southeastern Brazilian Atlantic Forest have been estimated, but investigations are biased to coastal evergreen sites. In this study density of three primate species was assessed through line-transect surveys in four semi-deciduous forest fragments (240 to 1450 ha) in Fazenda Barreiro Rico, eastern range of central Plateau of S{\~{a}}o Paulo state, Brazil. A total of 274 km was surveyed from January to October 2000. I estimated densities via DISTANCE software. Two of the largest fragments contained five primate species while two of the smallest ones harboured, respectively, four and two species. Densities of Cebus apella (15.34-47.92 ind./km2), Alouatta guariba (8.32-34.61), and Brachyteles arachnoides (19.92-35.11) were considerable. Differently from C. apella and A. guariba, B. arachnoides presented a density higher than previously estimated for the largest patch. The hypothetical minimum total population of B. arachnoides (601) may be the largest in semi-deciduous sites. This reinforces the value of the area in terms of its relative contribution for conservation of this endangered species. The narrow spatial scale distribution of forest fragments at Barreiro Rico and its proximity to academic institutions make the site suitable for programs of forest connectivity, studies on conservation biology, and wildlife management endeavours. {\textcopyright} Springer 2005.},

abstract = {Understanding how plant life history affects species vulnerability to anthropogenic disturbances and environmental change is a major ecological challenge. We examined how vegetation type, growth form, and geographic range size relate to extinction risk throughout the Brazilian Atlantic Forest domain. We used a database containing species-level information of 6,929 angiosperms within 112 families and a molecular-based working phylogeny. We used decision trees, standard regression, and phylogenetic regression to explore the relationships between species attributes and extinction risk. We found a significant phylogenetic signal in extinction risk. Vegetation type, growth form, and geographic range size were related to species extinction risk, but the effect of growth form was not evident after phylogeny was controlled for. Species restricted to either rocky outcrops or scrub vegetation on sandy coastal plains exhibited the highest extinction risk among vegetation types, a finding that supports the hypothesis that species adapted to resource-limited environments are more vulnerable to extinction. Among growth forms, epiphytes were associated with the highest extinction risk in non-phylogenetic regression models, followed by trees, whereas shrubs and climbers were associated with lower extinction risk. However, the higher extinction risk of epiphytes was not significant after correcting for phylogenetic relatedness. Our findings provide new indicators of extinction risk and insights into the mechanisms governing plant vulnerability to extinction in a highly diverse flora where human disturbances are both frequent and widespread.

abstract = {We studied the impacts of colonists, two groups of indigenous residents (Miskitu and Mayangna), and management by the Nicaraguan Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (MARENA) on the forest of the Bosawas International Biosphere Reserve. Indigenous people and colonists subsist on the natural resources of the reserve, and MARENA is responsible for protecting the area from colonization and illicit exploitation. Using geostatistical procedures and Landsat images at three different time periods, we compared per capita deforestation and boundary stabilization in areas with colonists and areas with indigenous peoples. We also examined whether the Mayangna deforested less than the Miskitu and whether the Nicaraguan government has effectively defended the Bosawas boundary against the advance of the agricultural frontier. In addition, we analyzed the current distribution of land uses within the reserve and its contiguous indigenous areas with a supervised classification of current land cover. Indigenous demarcations protected the forest successfully, whereas the Bosawas boundary itself did not inhibit colonization and consequent deforestation. Indigenous farmers deforested significantly less per capita than colonists, and the two indigenous groups in Bosawas did not differ significantly in their effects on the forest. Our results show that indigenous common-property institutions and indigenous defense of homeland have been powerful factors in protecting the forests of Bosawas and that the difficult evolution of a nested cross-scale governance system in Bosawas-under pressure from indigenous peoples-is probably the key to the forest's survival thus far.},

The effects of roads can be measured in both abiotic and biotic components of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. The nature of road systems as network structures renders vast areas of the landscape as road-affected, with small patches of isolated habitat remaining beyond the ecological influence of roads.

From 1996 to 1999, we recorded the number of individuals in different life stages in adjacent 10×10-m plots in two perpendicular transects across each of three fragments of different sizes (1.6, 6.4, and 9.9 ha) in the Reserva Nacional de Po{\c{c}}o das Antas, Southeastern Brazil. A fire burnt the fragments studied in 1997. Application of Morisita's Index showed clumping at most scales, with a marked reduction in clumping degree from youngs to adults, a pattern not influenced by fragment size. After fire, clumping degree increased temporarily among the youngs. No association between life stages was detected using presence/absence data. Palm density concentrated in the most disturbed transect arms, a pattern very little affected by fragment size or fire. No consistent relationship between palm density and distance from fragment edge was detected for any stage, fragment, or year. We hypothesize that short-distance seed dispersal by scatterhoarding rodents results in discrete, low-density clumps of youngs dissociated from reproductive plants. The spatial pattern of later stages is probably conditioned by the distribution of canopy gaps in the largest, more closed fragment. In the other fragments, the presence of large disturbed sectors promotes the formation of large, continuous stands of palms. This pattern would be reinforced by fire, which is known to be recurrent on already disturbed sites. For the species studied, large-scale variations in the forest structure (degraded vs. preserved fragment sectors) seems to be more important than microscale edge effects.},

abstract = {We live amid a global wave of anthropogenically driven biodiversity loss: species and population extirpations and, critically, declines in local species abundance. Particularly, human impacts on animal biodiversity are an under-recognized form of global environmental change. Among terrestrial vertebrates, 322 species have become extinct since 1500, and populations of the remaining species show 25{\%} average decline in abundance. Invertebrate patterns are equally dire: 67{\%} of monitored populations show 45{\%} mean abundance decline. Such animal declines will cascade onto ecosystem functioning and human well-being. Much remains unknown about this "Anthropocene defaunation"; these knowledge gaps hinder our capacity to predict and limit defaunation impacts. Clearly, however, defaunation is both a pervasive component of the planet's sixth mass extinction and also a major driver of global ecological change.},

The presence of fruits, reptiles, birds and mammals in the diet is occasional and opportunistic. Probably the higher consumption of a certain fish species compared to its availability and the high percentage of occurrence of T. fluviatilis in scats of the neotropical otter reflect their higher catchability.},

abstract = {Tropical forests show periods of scarcity and high fruit production in the same year and/or between years. Palms are an important component of Neotropical rainforests and a significant food resource for several frugivores. Therefore, their role as keystone resource may be exacerbated in highly impoverished areas. In Anchieta Island, S{\~{a}}o Paulo/Brazil, human settlements have modified and impoverished the forest, mainly through overharvesting and the introduction of exotic plants and several mammal species. We assessed the offer of fruits consumed by vertebrate frugivores at this island, the vegetation of which is belonging to the Brazilian Atlantic rainforest. We compared whether the fruiting patterns and fruit fall differ between palms and trees, and discuss the importance of palms as a food resource for frugivores and the implications for Anchieta Island conservation. Phenological patterns were seasonal for both trees and palms; however, the times of fruiting occurrence differed. Fruit fall biomass was at least twice lower than reported for other Atlantic rain forests and was also different between trees and palms. Palms contributed more than 80{\%} of the overall fruit fall biomass. Palms may constitute an alternative food resource in periods of low fruit availability, although they do not provide resources for the entire assemblage of vertebrate frugivores. Energy-rich fruits, such as those produced by palms, may play an important role in the maintenance of frugivore populations in isolated, disturbed environments with a high density of vertebrate frugivores, low diversity of fruiting species and fruit biomass such as those found on Anchieta Island. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier GmbH.

Pitfall traps sampled all 14 species (100{\%}), whereas ground cage traps sampled 8 species (57{\%}), and arboreal traps sampled 5 species (36{\%}). The sampling methodologies gave significantly different results, particularly between pitfall and cage traps, and between ground and arboreal cage traps. However, the comparison between Sherman and wire traps indicated no significant difference, although abundance has been higher for wire cages.

abstract = {Land managers often are responsible for the maintenance of species diversity and resilience. This requires knowledge of ecosystem dynamics over decades and centuries. Resource-driven (bottom-up) models have guided early thought on managing species and ecosystems. Under this paradigm, carnivores have little ecological value, and throughout the 20th Century carnivore management strategies (often extirpation) have reflected that concept. An alternative hypothesis, however, states that herbivores reduce the biomass of plants, but in turn, the biomass of herbi- vores is checked by the presence of carnivores. As such, carnivores have great ecological value. Their predation activities create impacts that ripple downward through the trophic levels of an ecosystem. Here we discuss some potential pathways through which carnivores contribute to ecosystem processes and species diversity. The subtleties of these interactions have strong impli- cations for management strategies of carnivores. Without considering these indirect impacts, short-sighted management strategies to reduce carnivores might cause extensive and long-term changes in ecosystem structure and function.},

We have used solution-oriented transdisciplinary research to understand the possible consequences of scattered tree decline in Australia's temperate grazing landscapes, and explore appropriate management and policy responses. Here, we document the scenario modelling process that culminated our stakeholder engagement. We simulated tree decline and its consequences for landscape aesthetics and biodiversity, using photo-realistic visualisations based on photographs identified as significant by graziers, and empirically derived habitat relationships for a series of birds and bats. The results foreshadow dramatic visual and ecological impacts for the region. We also modelled the aesthetic and habitat impacts of fully costed remediation scenarios, including widespread scattered tree planting and densely seeding poor paddocks under temporary stock exclusion. The visualisations revealed to the research team that: (1) dense seeding has a more lasting impact for scattered trees than scattered planting; (2) the benefits of any kind of planting is short-lived if accompanied by conventional grazing practices; and (3) grazed woodlands are most at risk. The graziers to whom we presented our scenarios in the last of our stakeholder workshops responded well to both kinds of visualisations, but it was clear that the experience also extracted a cost. We reflect here on our methods and outcomes, and draw out lessons from our work for other studies of tis kind. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In consequence of accelerated applications of new land-use systems, agricultural landscape research is challenged to provide results on their sustainability. Studies on biodiversity that are carried out with minimal sampling programs have become in-creasingly popular. However, concerning insects, the observed number of species in these studies underestimates the true species richness. In such studies, the non-para-metric estimators might provide a more reliable tool to gain information about the true species richness. The objective of this paper is to evaluate how accurately and pre-cisely estimates of species richness in studies with few pitfall samples correlate with those of studies with higher sampling intensity. This indicates how much effort could be saved in collecting data on species richness of insect communities. The species richness of carabid beetles at ten temporary wetlands in the East-German agricultural landscape was surveyed by nine pitfall traps per site. Estimates of species richness were calculated in scenarios with four, five or six pitfall traps per site. The observed number of species and the non-parametric estimators, Chao2, Bootstrap, Jacknife1 and Jacknife2, were included in the study to estimate species richness in each scenario, respectively. The estimates in the scenarios were compared with esti-mations based on the whole data set. While Chao2 was the most accurate and precise estimator, the Bootstrap estimator performed only slightly better than the number of observed species. Jacknife1 and 2 performed intermediately. Only Chao2 performed more precisely than the observed number of species. In conclusion, the number of samples might be reduced to five or six pitfall traps per site in studies carried out in small habitats with minimal sampling programs.

abstract = {1. Fifteen species richness estimators (three asymptotic based on species accumulation curves, 11 nonparametric, and one based in the species-area relationship) were compared by examining their performance in estimating the total species richness of epigean arthropods in the Azorean Laurisilva forests. Data obtained with standardized sampling of 78 transects in natural forest remnants of five islands were aggregated in seven different grains (i.e. ways of defining a single sample): islands, natural areas, transects, pairs of traps, traps, database records and individuals to assess the effect of using different sampling units on species richness estimations. 2. Estimated species richness scores depended both on the estimator considered and on the grain size used to aggregate data. However, several estimators (ACE, Chao 1, Jackknifel and 2 and Bootstrap) were precise in spite of grain variations. Weibull and several recent estimators [proposed by Rosenzweig et al. (Conservation Biology, 2003, 17, 864-874), and Ugland et al. (Journal of Animal Ecology, 2003, 72, 888-897)] performed poorly. 3. Estimations developed using the smaller grain sizes (pair of traps, traps, records and individuals) presented similar scores in a number of estimators (the above-mentioned plus ICE, Chao2, Michaelis-Menten, Negative Exponential and Clench). The estimations from those four sample sizes were also highly correlated. 4. Contrary to other studies, we conclude that most species richness estimators may be useful in biodiversity studies. Owing to their inherent formulas, several nonparametric and asymptotic estimators present insensitivity to differences in the way the samples are aggregated. Thus, they could be used to compare species richness scores obtained from different sampling strategies. Our results also point out that species richness estimations coming from small grain sizes can be directly compared and other estimators could give more precise results in those cases. We propose a decision framework based on our results and on the literature to assess which estimator should be used to compare species richness scores of different sites, depending on the grain size of the original data, and of the kind of data available (species occurrence or abundance data).},

abstract = {Most studies examining dominance hierarchies have focused at the intraspecific level. While some examples of interspecific hierarchies have been noted, these have usually been limited to a few species in the same taxonomic group that utilize resources in similar ways. Here, we examine evidence for dominance interference competition among vertebrates comprising a diverse frugivore community, including 19 species of birds, squirrels, and primates in a mature Central African rainforest. A total of 38 fruiting trees from 18 species were observed for 2058 h to record dominance interactions between foraging vertebrates. We show that interference competition occurs within and between taxonomically diverse species of vertebrates at fruiting trees. The resulting cross-taxonomic dominance hierarchy includes larger vertebrates, such as primates and hornbills, as well as smaller ones, such as squirrels and parrots. Within this hierarchy, the dominance rank of each species is highly correlated with body mass, and is shown to significantly affect the number of fruits removed from a given tree. Because a majority of tropical tree species depend on vertebrates to disperse their seeds, and particular vertebrates may preferentially disperse the seeds of specific tree species, results may have important conservation implications for the maintenance of tree diversity in regions where populations of larger frugivores have been depressed or extirpated},

abstract = {Population models incorporating demographic, environmental and genetic stochasticity were created from long-term data on natural populations of 30 species of vertebrates. The probability of extinction for a single population in a continuous habitat was compared to that of multiple isolated, or semi-isolated, populations occupying a fragmented landscape with an equivalent total carrying capacity. Populations occupying a fragmented landscape were modelled for a range of dispersal rates and levels of asynchrony in the effects of environmental disturbances. Dispersal among subpopulations in the fragmented landscape partially alleviates the effect of fragmentation on extinction rates, despite the models explicitly incorporating disease epidemics which spread between subpopulations through dispersal. Even moderate environmental correlations among subpopulations greatly reduces the viability of the metapopulation relative to the case where the populations are totally independent. Whether a population performed better as a single population or as a metapopulation was strongly affected by the carrying capacity assumed, the time frame examined and the initial fitness of the population. A single population always fared better when the total habitat available was capable of supporting ≤1000 adults. Thus, continued habitat fragmentation can be expected to fuel the ongoing global extinction crisis and conservation efforts should be aimed at interconnecting isolated habitat patches.},

abstract = {The seed dispersal system of Attalea geraensis (Arecaceae), an acaulescent palm, was investigated during one year in two Cerrado fragments in the state of S??o Paulo, southeastern Brazil. A. geraensis had inflorescences and infrutescences throughout the year. Two scatter-hoarding rodents (the spiny rat, Clyomys bishopi and agoutis, Dasyprocta azarae) were identified as seed predators/dispersers, able to move seeds up to 30 m from the palms, although most of the fruits (57.5{\%}) were dispersed less than 2 m. The removal rates were high and after 20 days, 97.2{\%} of the fruits were removed. Fruit fate was not related to fruit mass, length and diameter. The application of Morisita's index showed a more clumped distribution of adults in the smaller fragment, probably because of the absence of agoutis. Higher seed removal by rodents in the large Cerrado remnant may decrease seed predation by beetles. ?? 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Evidence concerning mechanisms hypothesized to explain species coexistence in hyper-diverse communities is reviewed for tropical forest plants. Three hypotheses receive strong support. Niche differences are evident from non-random spatial distributions along micro-topographic gradients and from a survivorship-growth tradeoff during regeneration. Host-specific pests reduce recruitment near reproductive adults (the Janzen-Connell effect), and, negative density dependence occurs over larger spatial scales among the more abundant species and may regulate their populations. A fourth hypothesis, that suppressed understory plants rarely come into competition with one another, has not been considered before and has profound implications for species coexistence. These hypotheses are mutually compatible. Infrequent competition among suppressed understory plants, niche differences, and Janzen-Connell effects may facilitate the coexistence of the many rare plant species found in tropical forests while negative density dependence regulates the few most successful and abundant species.},

However, most of these species will end up as terminal hosts for the virus, since a fatal outcome is the rule and usually no virus dissemination from such hosts occur. Nevertheless, in nature, RV has become adapted to certain species, referred to as " natural hosts " , which act as reservoirs for the virus. During the process of virus adaptation to such hosts, genomic and eventually antigenic modifications are generated that can be used as markers which may help to identify the natural host which acted as source of infection, along with other characteristics peculiar to such modified viruses, denominated RV " variants " . Such variants may bear alterations that can be used as epidemiological markers, allowing for instance the identification of the source of infection or the establishment of asso-ciations between a particular variant and a defined ecological niche. In this brief review, some of the recent data on the virus and the occurrence of variants are presented, with emphasis on the findings of a parcel of the various studies on the subject that have been carried out in Brazil. Epidemiologic data on reported cases of rabies in the country in the last ten years (1997-2006) are presented and discussed, highlighting the marked decrease in the numbers of urban cases of rabies in dogs and humans, what was unfortunately compensated by an increase in the number of human cases associated to vampire bat transmission in the trienium 2004-2006.},

abstract = {This article examines the potential and problems associated with global environmental governance with particular reference to Transfrontier Conservation Areas (TFCAs) in Southern Africa. By taking a political ecology approach, it reflects on theories and practices of global environmental governance through an analysis of transboundary environmental management. In particular, it examines the politics of the struggle over control of and access to key natural resources and how it impacts on the implementation of transfrontier conservation. In order to do this, this article includes an analysis of the complex role of local and global NGOs, the changing role of the state in relation to international actors, the importance of community based natural resource management, the commitment to tourism to make conservation pay its way and the problems associated with illicit networks of traffickers of wildlife products, cars and people. It is important to investigate the politics of TFCAs because they are part of a wider context of increasing forms of transnational management of the environment; such transnational forms of management are often deemed to be more effective than national level management because of the transboundary nature of environmental problems. This article argues that the assumption that transnational management can be neatly implemented needs rethinking. In particular, it highlights the ways that complex networks of actors constitute a significant challenge to global environmental governance. This in turn raises more general questions about the effectiveness of other forms of global environmental governance centred on managing problems such as climate change, pollution or trafficking of endangered species and tropical hardwoods. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {P{\textgreater} Ecosystems support biodiversity and also provide goods and services that are beneficial to humans. The extent to which the locations that are most valuable for ecosystem services coincide with those that support the most biodiversity is of critical importance when designing conservation and land management strategies. There are, however, few studies on which to base any kind of conclusion about possible spatial patterns of association between ecosystem services and biodiversity. Moreover, little is known about the sensitivity of the conclusions to the quality of the data available, or to the choice and size of the region used for analysis. Here, we first present national-scale estimates of the spatial covariance in areas important for ecosystem services and biodiversity (richness of species of conservation concern), using Britain as a case study. We then explore how these associations are sensitive to the spatial resolution of the available data, the spatial extent of our study region and to regional variation across the study area. Our analyses reveal a mixture of negative and positive associations. In particular, the regionalization analysis shows that one can arrive at diametrically opposing conclusions about relationships between ecosystem services and biodiversity by studying the same question within different areas, even within a moderately small island. Synthesis and applications. In a policy context, the location-specific nature of relationships between ecosystem services and biodiversity underscores the importance of multi-scale environmental decision-making, so as to reflect both local conditions and broader-scale priorities. The results also suggest that efforts to establish general patterns of congruence in ecosystem services and biodiversity may offer a less constructive way forward than do more regional approaches.},

abstract = {At the end of the 1970s otter surveys were developed to study the distribution of the Eurasian otter Lutra lutra. The method was quickly adopted and expanded to include other species of otter. Different methods to estimate otter density were also used. There is some uncertainty, however, as to the significance and precision of the results. Otter surveys, radio-tracking studies and otter censuses (tracks and visual) were conducted in the same areas simultaneously. Comparison of the home ranges of otters tagged with transmitters with the results from otter surveys carried out in the same areas showed very similar otter distribution. Some 71{\%} of those sites examined in which only one otter lived were positive, and 97{\%} of those sites with two or more otters. Differences were found between different watercourses. In small or average sites with waterways, one single otter was capable of marking many kilometres so that it could be detected in most of the conventional 600 m sites (here 71{\%} of sites). The data obtained by radio-tracking showed that almost all otters can be seen by experienced observers, confirming the validity of visual censuses. A high correlation was found between the number of otters seen during visual censuses and the number of otters detected by means of the length of their footprints. Using new and old tracks (2-days-old or more) the number of otters was overestimated.},

abstract = {Vertebrates play a fundamental role in the dispersal of Neotropical trees, generating different seed shadows according to their physical and behavioral features. Tapirs are capable of consuming great quantities of large fruits, and they defecate seeds far from parent trees. For instance, intact seeds of the palm Syagrus romanzoffiana have been found in tapir dung piles in the Atlantic Forest of southeastern Brazil, suggesting that tapirs effectively disperse this species. However, recruitment was not examined therein.We studied tapir endozoochory of large and medium seeds in the semi-deciduous Atlantic Forest of Argentina by examining dung piles found within Iguazu National Park. We recorded dung-pile positions to evaluate the spatial distribution. We also counted the number of juveniles in 22mquadrats placed on old dung piles in latrines, beneath adults and in random sites to estimate recruitment levels. Syagrus romanzoffiana seeds were present in 98 percent of dung piles, averaging 4200 seeds/dung pile, indicating that this species constitutes the main fruit component in the tapir's diet. Dung piles showed a clumped deposition pattern reflecting the use of latrines. Juvenile recruitment in latrines was 21 times higher than that of under-adult sites and 500 times greater than in random sites, and correlated with the frequency of use of the areas. We concluded that the lowland tapir is a major disperser of S. romanzoffiana. Given that this palm can be considered a keystone species, a disruption of this interaction might affect the entire community of frugivores in the long term.},

L. longicaudis used almost all types of natural cavities available along river banks, and they excavated burrows or found shelter in dense grass. Two large caves were used as shelters and also to raise young. The degree of conservation of the forest and human disturbance around the shelters did not influence use by otters. However, otters used shelters located higher on the river banks more frequently, probably because they were less vulnerable to flooding. Considering all shelters found during 1 year, shelters of L. longicaudis were distributed at random along the stream, and scent marks were not concentrated around them. Number of shelters in use per month was constant throughout the year, indicating that this can be used to monitor populations of river otters.},

abstract = {1.Camera trapping is a widely applied method to study mammalian biodiversity and is still gaining popularity. It can quickly generate large amounts of data which need to be managed in an efficient and transparent way that links data acquisition with analytical tools. 2.We describe the free and open source R package camtrapR, a new toolbox for flexible and efficient management of data generated in camera trap based wildlife studies. The package implements a complete workflow for processing camera trapping data. It assists in image organisation, species and individual identification, data extraction from images, tabulation and visualisation of results and export of data for subsequent analyses. There is no limitation to the number of images stored in this data management system; the system is portable and compatible across operating systems. 3.The functions provide extensive automation to minimise data entry mistakes and, apart from species and individual identification, require minimal manual user input. Species and individual identification are performed outside the R environment, either via tags assigned in dedicated image management software or by moving images into species directories. 3.Input for occupancy and (spatial) capture-recapture analyses for density and abundance estimation, e.g. in the R packages unmarked or secr, is computed in a flexible and reproducible manner. In addition, survey summary reports can be generated, spatial distributions of records can be plotted and exported to GIS software, and single and two-species activity patterns can be visualised. 4.camtrapR allows for streamlined and flexible camera trap data management and should be most useful to researchers and practitioners who regularly handle large amounts of camera trapping data.

abstract = {Individuals living in social groups are predicted to live under unequal predation risk due to their spatial location within the group. Previous work has indicated that individuals located at the edge of groups have higher "domains of danger", thus are more likely to engage in vigilance or antipredator behavior. We studied the determinants of vigilance behavior in two groups of ring-tailed coatis in Iguazu National Park, Argentina. In addition to the expected pattern that coatis were more vigilant at the edge of the group, we found that individuals were particularly vigilant at the front edge of the group. This pattern conforms to predictions of differing predation risk caused by sit-and-wait predators with respect to mobile animal groups. In addition, coatis exhibited less vigilance when the number of neighbors within 5 m and group size increased. Of the three spatial variables tested, within-group spatial position was the most important predictor variable determining vigilance levels. These results confirm that spatial position has major effects on vigilance behavior, and that group directionality is an important factor which should be taken into account when measuring vigilance behavior. Coatis were more vigilant when juveniles less than 6 months old were in the groups. The presence of these young juveniles also affected the relationship between alarm response and vigilance levels. Coatis were more vigilant after strong alarm reactions, but only when young juveniles were not present in the groups. This may indicate that coatis give differential responses to alarm calls depending on the age of the caller. A comparison of antipredator vigilance between coatis and sympatric capuchin monkeys is consistent with the hypothesis that terrestriality leads to higher perceive predation risk for coatis.},

abstract = {Using standardized small mammal surveys at 26 Atlantic Forest sites, we evaluated the efficiency and compared the weight of captured species and individuals between large pitfall traps and Sherman traps. We also investigated the effects of climatic variables on daily capture success of pitfalls. Pitfalls were clearly more efficient than Sherman traps, capturing 29 species, of which 16 were captured exclusively with this method, mostly represented by rare species. In contrast, Sherman traps captured 14 species, of which just 1 was not captured with pitfall traps. Compared to Sherman traps, pitfalls captured (per site) 3 times the number of species, 2 times the number of individuals, and significantly more individuals of 7 species. Despite differences in sampling efficiency, positive correlations suggest that at least coarse-scale variation among sites for several assemblage parameters are congruent between the 2 trapping methods. Sherman traps tended to capture adults, whereas pitfalls captured individuals over a broader range of weight classes or tended to capture more juveniles. Total daily capture rates in pitfall traps increased with precipitation. Our results suggest that large pitfall traps are effective at capturing rare species and juveniles, probably because they are less selective, and are thus essential for inventorying the rich and poorly known small mammal fauna of the tropics and for demographic studies.},

We recorded 415 deaths from 44 species of seven families in all Brazilian biomes. We did not observe a relationship between body size or type of flight with the number of bat-vehicle collisions. Frugivore was the trophic guild most victimized, possibly due to greater natural abundance, foraging in low height airspace, and capacity to make long-distance movements. The elevated number of species recorded indicates that these roads may exert a negative effect on bat fauna. We encourage road ecologists and environmental agencies to include bats in their fauna monitoring of road infrastructure and request to make more accurate estimates of this impact.},

abstract = {Climate change models predict that much of western North America is becoming significantly warmer and drier, resulting in overall reductions in availability of water for ecosystems. Herein, I demonstrate that significant declines in the reproductive success of female insectivorous bats occurs in years when annual environmental conditions mimic the long-term predictions of regional climate change models. Using a data set gathered on bat populations from 1996 through 2008 along the Front Range of Colorado, I compare trends in population numbers and reproductive outcomes of six species of vespertilionid bats with data on mean annual high temperature, precipitation, snow pack and stream discharge rates. I show that levels of precipitation and flow rates of small streams near maternity colonies is fundamentally tied to successful reproduction in female bats; particularly during the lactation phase. Across years that experienced greater than average mean temperatures with less than average precipitation and stream flow, bat populations responded by slight to profound reductions in reproductive output depending on the severity of drought conditions. In particular, reproductive outputs showed profound declines (32{\%} - 51{\%}) when discharge rates of the largest stream in the field area dropped below 7 cubic meters per second, indicating a threshold response. Such sensitivity to environmental change portends severe impacts to regional bat populations if current scenarios for climate change in western North America are accurate. In addition, bats act as early-warning indicators of large-scale ecological effects resulting from further regional warming and drying trends currently at play in western North America.},

abstract = {The ongoing worldwide biodiversity crisis comes along with a growing demand for feasible environmental indicators to measure, evaluate and communicate anthropogenic influence on biodiversity. Those indicators can be useful tools for national and regional management and support decision making processes. We propose degree of naturalness (N d), distance to natural habitat (D n) and the composite index distance to nature (D 2N) as a highly comprehensible environmental indicator set that can be used as surrogate for land use related anthropogenic influence on biodiversity. A high resolution naturalness map for Austria based on the best nationwide available land use data was produced and used to test and demonstrate the applicability of the indicator set. Spatially inclusive and comprehensive indicator maps were calculated for the entire country (83,872 km 2). Exemplary indicator values for all 2359 municipalities and six altitudinal zones were calculated and evaluated. Indicator maps of Austria clearly delimitate regions with elevated anthropogenic pressure on biodiversity due to land use characteristics. A sensitivity analysis conducted to evaluate the effect of land use data with different spatial and thematic resolution on the indicators showed that D n reacts sensitive to spatially more detailed information about natural and near natural habitats. By contrast N d and D 2N were robust regarding the spatial and thematic resolution of input data. The proposed indicators do not measure biodiversity or a part of it directly, but the degree of habitat changes caused by anthropogenic land use, therefore they can be used for analysis over wide geographic ranges including different bio-geographic or climatic zones, and different spatial scales. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Saimiri has a complicated taxonomic history, and there is continuing disagreement about the number of valid taxa. Despite these controversies, one point of consensus among morphologists has been that the eastern Amazonian populations of squirrel monkeys form a single terminal taxon, Saimiri sciureus sciureus (Linnaeus, 1758). This group is distributed to both the north and south of the middle to lower Amazon River and in the Maraj{\'{o}} Archipelago. However, a recent molecular study by Lavergne and colleagues suggested that the Saimiri sciureus complex (comprised of S. s. sciureus sensu lato, S. s. albigena, S. s. macrodon, and S. s. cassiquiarensis) was paraphyletic. The discordance between morphological and molecular studies prompted us to conduct a new multidisciplinary analysis, employing a combination of morphological, morphometric, and molecular markers. Our results suggest the currently recognized taxon S. s. sciureus contains two distinct species, recognized by the Phylogenetic Species Concept: Saimiri sciureus (Linnaeus, 1758) and Saimiri collinsi Osgood, 1916. East Amazonian squirrel monkeys north of the Amazon have a gray crown (S. sciureus), and south of the Amazon, the crown is yellow (S. collinsi). Morphometric measurements also clearly distinguish between the two species, with the most important contributing factors including width across upper canines for both sexes. For males, the mean zygomatic breadth was significantly wider in S. sciureus compared to S. collinsi, and for females, the width across the upper molars was wider in S. sciureus compared to S. collinsi. Mitochondrial phylogenetic analyses support this separation of the eastern Amazonian squirrel monkeys into two distinct taxa, recovering one clade (S. sciureus) distributed to the north of the Amazon River, from the Negro River and Branco River to the Guiana coast and the Brazilian state of Amap{\'{a}}, and another clade (S. collinsi) south of the Amazon River, from the region of the Tapaj{\'{o}}s River to the state of Maranh{\~{a}}o, as well as within the Maraj{\'{o}} Archipelago. The revalidation of the species S. collinsi was corroborated by all of the methods in the study, as the clades recovered in our molecular study are congruent with the pattern of morphological variation. We confirm both the paraphyly of the Saimiri sciureus complex and the paraphyly of the subspecies S. s. sciureus as defined in the current literature.},

abstract = {The Neotropical otter Lontra longicaudis is a widespread semiaquatic carnivore living in a wide variety of environments in both fresh-water and salt-water ecosystems. We summarise the current knowledge on distribution, ecology, behaviour, evolution and conservation status of the species, and highlight the main threats that have been affecting it as well as priority actions for securing its survival. The current geographical range of Lontra longicaudis is discussed, as well as several efforts that have been made to update knowledge of the range. Throughout its known distribution area, the Neotropical otter has high genetic diversity, and recent molecular research suggests that variations in genetic diversity are related to geography. Taxonomic issues regarding the existence of subspecies persist, mainly due to limited sampling in key portions of the species' range. Although the Neotropical otter is widely distributed in Latin America and has flexible behaviour, it is subjected to a variety of threats, which lead this otter to be officially considered Threatened in several countries within its geographical range. The species still faces an uncertain future due to the impact of human activities, thus justifying its classification as Near Threatened in the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List. The real level of human-otter conflicts and the impact of modified environments on Neotropical otter populations are still unclear, and must be a priority focus of future studies. There is an urgent need to increase our knowledge on aspects of the Neotropical otter's biology, such as reproduction, generation time, behaviour, physiology, distribution limits, sanitary aspects, evolution and taxonomy. Understanding these topics is vital to ensure the long-term survival of the species, both at the local and at the regional scale, as well as to provide the basis for environmental education actions involving local riverside human communities.},

abstract = {The hypothesis that seed or seedling predation by host-specific herbivores can explain the coexistence of the large number of tree species in tropical forests, and produce a low density and uniform dispersion of adults of these tree species, is examined. On theoretical grounds, it is shown that spacing of conspecific adults can account for only a very small fraction of the observed tree species richness in tropical forests unless interadult distances are quite large. Moreover, in growing or declining populations, seed predation will not result in large-scale uniformity in adult dispersion patterns throughout the population. It results in uniformity in equilibrium populations only if the same spacing rule applies to all adult trees. However, adult trees differ enormously in seed production from year to year, and from young (small) to old (large) adults. High variance in seed production from tree to tree and year to year leads to heterogeneity in the intensity of seed predation and in the spacing distance between adults. This explains why the adults of most tropical tree species are clumped or randomly dispersed, and not uniformly spaced, in spite of heavy seed predation in many species. Because tree species are not everywhere as dense as whould be predicted from observed nearest neighbor distances, it is concluded that other factors than seed predation limit the abundance of tropical tree species and prevent single-species dominance. /// ????????? ???????? ? ???, ??? ??????????? ????? ??? ?????????? ??????????, ??????????????????? ? ????????????? ???? ????????? ????????, ????? ????????? ??????????????? ???????? ????? ????? ???????? ? ??????????? ?????, ?????? ????????? ? ??????????? ????????????? ?????? ???????? ???? ?????. ?? ????????????? ?????? ????????, ??? ???????????????? ????????????? ???????? ???????? ?????? ???? ???????????? ???? ????????? ?????? ????? ???????? ????????? ???????? ? ??????????? ????, ???? ?????????? ????? ??????? ????????? ???????????? ???????. ????? ????, ? ????????????? ??? ????????? ?????????? ???????? ????? ?? ???????? ? ???????????????? ????????????? ? ????????? ????????????????? ????????????? ???????? ???????? ? ???????? ??????????????? ?????????. ??? ???????? ????????????? ? ?????????????? ?????????? ???? ? ??????, ???? ???????? ????????????????? ????????????? ???????? ? ???? ????????????????. ?????? ???????? ??????? ?????? ??????????? ?? ????????? ????? ? ?????? ???? ? ? ?????? ????????. ??????? ????????? ? ????????? ????? ? ?????? ????, ? ????? ?????????????? ????????? ???????? ? ????????????? ???????? ? ????????????? ??????????? ????? ? ??????????????? ????????????? ???????? ????????. ??? ?????????, ?????? ????????????? ???????? ???????? ??????????? ??????????? ????? ???????????? ??? ???????? ? ????????????, ???????? ?? ??????????? ?????????? ????? ?????????? ? ?????? ?????. ??? ??? ????????? ???? ???????? ?? ????? ??????????? ? ??? ?????????, ??????? ????? ??????????? ?? ?????????? ????? ?????????? ????????? ?????????, ??????? ??????????, ??? ?????? ??????????? ???????? ???????????? ????? ?????? ????????, ?????? ???????? ?????, ??????? ???????????? ? ????????????? ????????? ?????.},

Our survival data do not support the escape hypothesis. Predation levels declined with increasing seedling density (positive density-dependent survival), but seedling survival after 15 mo was not distance-dependent. Nevertheless, a unimodal (hump-shaped) recruitment curve, typically associatedwith decreasing seedlingdensityandincreasing seedling survivalwith distance, was observed. In the context of ballistic dispersal, this recruitment curve may indicate a hump-shaped dispersal kernel with predator satiation at high seedling densities near a parent tree. This recruitment curve likely arises because generalized insect seedling predatorswhile attracted to the adult trees also tend to forage farther away. Short dispersal distances, in turn generate the high densities needed to satiate seed and seedling predators. Predator satiation results in long-term survival rates in P. sutherlandii similar tomorewidely dispersed and less common tree species.},

The Legal Reserves (RLs) and Permanent Protected Areas (APPs) of the Brazilian Forest Code provide an important strategy to maintain this diversity. Yet a proposed amendment to Brazil's 1965 forestry code would reduce protection of Brazil's forests, including the Amazon and the Atlantic forest, and bring irreversible detrimental effects to mammal diversity. Mammals are key components of forest ecosystem, providing important environmental services as pollinators, seed dispersers and ecosystem engineers. The local extinction of some species will negatively affect forest ecosystem service provisioning throughout the country. Another important effect of forest conversion within private properties, should the proposed changes happen, will be the emergence of new diseases, bringing serious public health problems in Brazil.},

abstract = {In Community Ecology and in many applications of Conservation Biology, diversity means variety of species, which may or not include information on the relative importance of each species. Diversity is one of the most important attributes in the study of communities and, as a result, many methods are available to its measurement. Among them, non-parametric diversity (or heterogeneity) indices such as Shannon and Simpson formulae are widely employed in a range of studies. These indices are composed of (or confound) two components, species richness and evenness. Different indices can be obtained combining the two components with different weights. The lack of an objective criteria to guide appropriate weighting of each component results in an arbitrary decision to use an index and not another. Additionally, depending on the weight the indices give to each component, an index may indicate that community A is more diversified than community B while a second index may indicate the contrary. Also, diversity indices applied to samples differing in species richness and evenness may produce similar values. Such problems can be avoided using alternative methods. One of them is diversity profile, which includes not one index but many diversity indices differing in the weight given to each component. Additional alternatives include the use of species richness only, Whittaker's diagram (or of dominance) and scatter diagrams with axes defined by species richness and an evenness index. Except by species richness, the cited alternative methods show graphically much more information than that contained in a single value produced by a diversity index. In studies requiring a response variable to be modeled in relation to predictor variables (Linear Models such as Regression and Analysis of Variance), I suggest the separate use of species richness and evenness as each one may reflect different aspect of communities.},

abstract = {1. Natural resource agencies often rely on surveys of animal sign (e.g. scat, scent marks, tracks) for population assessment, with repeat surveys required to model and account for uncertain detection. Using river otter Lontra canadensis snow-track survey data as a motivating example, we develop a 3-level occupancy model with parameters that describe (i) site-level occupancy probabilities, (ii) otter movement (and thus, track availability) and (iii) recorded presence-absence of tracks (conditional on the availability of tracks for detection). 2. We incorporated several recent developments in occupancy modelling, including the presence of both false negatives and false positives, spatial and temporal correlation and repeated sampling across distinct observers. 3. We investigated optimal allocation of sampling effort (e.g. within and among snowfall events) using simulations. We also compared models that allowed site-level occupancy and track-laying processes to be spatially correlated with models that assumed independence among sites. 4. Both types of models (independence and spatial) performed well across a range of simulated parameter values, but the spatial model resulted in more accurate point estimates for detection parameters and credibility intervals with better coverage rates when data were spatially correlated. When applied to real data, the spatial model resulted in a higher estimate of the occupancy rate than the baseline model (0{\textperiodcentered}82 vs. 0{\textperiodcentered}59). A minimum of 15-20 helicopter flights, distributed among at least three unique snow events, were needed to meet precision goals (standard error). 5. Synthesis and applications. We describe a flexible and robust occupancy modelling framework that accounts for heterogeneous detection rates in surveys of animal sign. The method allows for spatially correlated sites and should have broad relevance to surveys conducted by many natural resource agencies. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors.

abstract = {The diet of the Neotropical otter Lontra longicaudis (Olfers, 1818) is one of the best known aspects of its biology throughout its distribution range. However, most dietary studies have been undertaken during short time periods, making it difficult to identify temporal patterns in the feeding behavior of the species. The present study aimed to describe the diet of L. longicaudis in the lower region of the Mambucaba Catchment, state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, during a three year period, based on analyses of spraints (feces). The results show fish as the main prey item (frequency of occurrence, FO = 85.78{\%}), as already described in previous studies. Crustaceans were the second main prey (FO = 70.67{\%}), occurring in the spraints during the whole year, however presenting a higher frequency of occurrence than fish in samples collected during some months. Anurans were the third most important prey item (FO = 9.56{\%}) and mammals, birds and reptiles were preyed upon only rarely (less than 4{\%}). Fish and crustaceans were present in the diet of the species throughout the year and frogs were important mostly from June to August (dry season). This higher rate of predation on amphibians during the drier months was probably related to the decrease of the main prey. {\textcopyright} 2011 Sociedade Brasileira de Zoologia.},

abstract = {1 Although, in nature, seed dispersal usually declines with distance from the source, seedling establishment patterns are highly variable. An increase in seed survival can lead to either hump-shaped (Janzen-Connell (J-C) pattern) or declining (Hubbell pattern) establishment with distance from seed source, but declining establishment can also be generated if survival decreases with distance (McCanny pattern). Pathogens and seed predators are considered to be major mortality agents structuring recruitment patterns, but it is unclear how well predation alone can explain variation in these patterns. 2 We introduce a simple mechanistic model showing that distance and density-dependent seed predation can generate all of the observed recruitment patterns. Our approach provides the first mathematical reconstruction of conceptual models previously considered to be based on contrasting underlying mechanisms. Three easily measurable quantities (the proportion of seeds escaping predation at the source, and the mean distance from the source of dispersed seeds and of predators' activity) can be used to test for consistency with the J-C pattern. The association between recruitment patterns and plant (dispersal) and animal (predation) characteristics is robust with respect to parameter values and various functional forms. 3 The model shows that the J-C pattern can occur only if the mean distance over which predators are active is lower than that over which seeds are dispersed, corresponding to a system with host-specific, or immobile, seed predators (often invertebrates) that are restricted to areas of high seed density near adult plants, and therefore selecting for longer dispersal distances of seeds. 4 The Hubbell pattern is generated by the model when dispersal and predation distances are of equivalent magnitudes. The McCanny pattern emerges if more generalized, or more mobile, seed predators (often vertebrates) are attracted to the adult trees but also tend to forage farther away, thereby selecting for short dispersal distances that generate high densities needed to satiate seed predators. 5 The model also predicts that the total number of seeds surviving predation is lowest at intermediate distances, suggesting that distance-dependent predation promotes either short or long dispersal distances, or both (dimorphism).},

abstract = {Several studies have shown that soil biotic communities from organically managed fields are more diverse and exhibit higher activity levels compared to conventionally managed fields. The impact of these different soil communities on plant productivity and the provision of soil ecosystem services are, however, still unclear. Here, we test the effects of soil inoculation from each of three organic and three conventional maize fields on maize productivity and nutrient loss during leaching events induced by simulated rain. In particular, we examine whether differences in productivity and nutrient loss are related to the abundance and species composition of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. We hypothesized that soil biota from organically managed fields would improve maize growth and reduce nutrient leaching significantly more than those from conventionally managed fields. In contrast to our hypothesis, we found that plant productivity was negatively affected by soil inoculation, and this effect was stronger with inoculum from organic fields. Plant productivity was inversely correlated with AMF abundance, suggesting that enhanced carbon allocation to AMF is at least in part responsible for plant growth reduction under our experimental conditions. However, soil inoculation did alter the ecological functioning of the system by reducing phosphorus leaching losses after simulated rain. Moreover, these leaching losses were lower with increased hyphal density and were related with abundance of particular AMF types, suggesting that abundance of AMF and their community composition may be useful indicators of phosphorus leaching losses. The results demonstrate that soil communities from different agricultural fields vary in their impact on plant productivity and nutrient leaching losses. The results further indicate that there is a potential tradeoff between positive effects of soil communities on sustainability and negative effects on crop productivity.},

abstract = {The feeding habits of the neotropical river otter Lontra longicaudis were studied in a headwater stream of the Atlantic Forest, south-eastern Brazil, for 17 months. The otters fed mainly on fish (93{\%} of the scats), but invertebrates were also frequent items in the diet (78.9{\%} of the scats), as observed for the same species in lentic habitats and for other species of Lontra as well. It is suggested that the high proportion of invertebrates in the diet in comparison to Lutra is related to differences in the dentition of the two genera. The observed seasonal variation in the diet of L. longicaudis was probably a result of fluctuations in the abundance of a main prey item, a megalopteran larva (Corydalus sp.). Prey selection, regarded as differences between rates of predation and relative abundance of food items, was demonstrated for the two most important groups of otter prey: fish and crustaceans. Although they are able to capture mobile prey, otters seem to prefer feeding on prey showing lower escape ability - among fish they select armoured catfish, and among crustaceans they select crabs.},

abstract = {The statistical power of sampling regimes to detect significant changes in abundance has received little attention when designing bat-monitoring programmes. Put simply, power is a statistical measure of the risk of not detecting a trend in a population when one actually exists. Failure to identify trends with confidence could mean that populations heading towards extinction go unrecognised. Adequacy of monitoring programmes depends on interactions between sample size (number of counts), duration (years of monitoring), frequency of surveys, and the ability to control variability in counts because of other factors (e.g. weather). If the power of monitoring programmes is not assessed, researchers run the risk of wasting resources from the outset because the sampling regime may be inadequate to detect trends with confidence. We provide a case study of the application of power analysis to designing long-term monitoring programmes for the long-tailed bat (Chalinolobus tuberculatus), a threatened species from New Zealand. We calculated random variation within and between transects and years from a pilot study, and used a route-regression technique incorporating individual error terms to estimate power. Counts of C. tuberculatus are inherently variable, even after standardisation of counts, so obtaining sufficient power to detect changes in abundance demands large sample sizes or long-term monitoring programmes. We provide power figures that can be used by conservation managers to choose options for designing programmes. Given that resources are usually limited, in most situations we recommend that programmes should achieve 80-90{\%} power, aim to measure population changes in the order of 3-10{\%} per year, monitor 50-100 transects once per year per study area, and should run for {\textgreater}I 0 years.},

abstract = {Wildlife-vehicle collisions (WVC) amount to 11{\%} of all registered traffic crashes in the Czech Republic causing, apart from numerous deaths and serious injuries to animals, property damage and injuries to car passengers. Odor repellents have the potential to lower the overall number of WVC and allow animals to cross roads at the same time. We tested the effectiveness of odor repellent preparation in prevention of WVC. 18 places were selected on the Czech road network where WVC were concentrated on the basis of traffic crash data. Control sections on the same road segments were also delimited in order to keep the traffic intensities constant. We applied a Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) study design to control not only the effect of the measures but also the expected natural variations in wildlife populations over time. Data were compared before and after odor repellent installations. Wildlife carcass gathering was carried out during the spring and autumn. We also used the police crash database to supplement carcass data when no field works were carried out. 201 killed mammals (roe deer and wild boars) were identified in total over 47 months. We applied a Bayesian approach as only a limited numbers of WVC were available. A WVC decrease between 26 – 43{\%} can be expected on the treated road sections. These numbers are, however, up to three-times lower than those claimed by producers of odor preparations.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

These criticisms primarily concern the fact that heuristic algorithms cannot guarantee an optimal solution to the problem of representing a group of targeted natural features in a subset of the sites in a region. We discuss optimality in the context of a range of needs for conservation planning. We point out that classical integer linear programming methods that guarantee an optimal solution, like branch and bound algorithms, are currently intractable for many realistic problems. We also show that heuristics have practical advantages over classical methods and that suboptimality is not necessarily a disadvantage for many real-world applications. Further work on alternative reserve selection algorithms is certainly needed, but the necessary criteria for assessing their utility must be broader than mathematical optimality.

Our data reflected the faunal heterogeneity with respect to both elevation and vegetation because only eight of the 19 species were collected at both high and low elevations. The composition of the small mammal fauna of the park is influenced by predominance of forest formations at low elevations and cerrado with rupestrian areas at high elevations.

abstract = {The jaguar (Panthera onca), the largest felid in the American Continent, is currently threatened by habitat loss, fragmentation and human persecution. We have investigated the genetic diversity, population structure and demographic history of jaguars across their geographical range by analysing 715 base pairs of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region and 29 microsatellite loci in ≈40 individuals sampled from Mexico to southern Brazil. Jaguars display low to moderate levels of mtDNA diversity and medium to high levels of microsatellite size variation, and show evidence of a recent demographic expansion. We estimate that extant jaguar mtDNA lineages arose 280 000-510 000 years ago (95{\%} CI 137 000-830 000 years ago), a younger date than suggested by available fossil data. No strong geographical structure was observed, in contrast to previously proposed subspecific partitions. However, major geographical barriers such as the Amazon river and the Darien straits between northern South America and Central America appear to have restricted historical gene flow in this species, producing measurable genetic differentiation. Jaguars could be divided into four incompletely isolated phylogeographic groups, and further sampling may reveal a finer pattern of subdivision or isolation by distance on a regional level. Operational conservation units for this species can be defined on a biome or ecosystem scale, but should take into account the historical barriers to dispersal identified here. Conservation strategies for jaguars should aim to maintain high levels of gene flow over broad geographical areas, possibly through active management of disconnected populations on a regional scale.},

abstract = {The idiosyncratic behaviours of seed dispersers are important contributors to plant spatial associations and genetic structures. In this study, we used a combination of field, molecular and spatial studies to examine the connections between seed dispersal and the spatial and genetic structures of a dominant neotropical palm Attalea phalerata. Field observation and genetic parentage analysis both indicated that the majority of A. phalerata seeds were dispersed locally over short distances ({\textless}30 m from the maternal tree). Spatial and genetic structures between adults and seedlings were consistent with localized and short-distance seed dispersal. Dispersal contributed to spatial associations among maternal sibling seedlings and strong spatial and genetic structures in both seedlings dispersed near ({\textless}10 m) and away ({\textgreater}10 m) from maternal palms. Seedlings were also spatially aggregated with juveniles. These patterns are probably associated with the dispersal of seeds by rodents and the survival of recruits at specific microsites or neighbourhoods over successive fruiting periods. Our cross-cohort analyses found palms in older cohorts and cohort pairs were associated with a lower proportion of offspring and sibling neighbours and exhibited weaker spatial and genetic structures. Such patterns are consistent with increased distance- and density-dependent mortality over time among palms dispersed near maternal palms or siblings. The integrative approaches used for this study allowed us to infer the importance of seed dispersal activities in maintaining the aggregated distribution and significant genetic structures among A. phalerata palms. We further conclude that distance- and density-dependent mortality is a key postdispersal process regulating this palm population.},

abstract = {Movement is important to all organisms, and accordingly it is addressed in a huge number of papers in the literature. Of nearly 26,000 papers referring to movement, an estimated 34{\%} focused on movement by measuring it or testing hypotheses about it. This enormous amount of information is difficult to review and highlights the need to assess the collective completeness of movement studies and identify gaps. We surveyed 1,000 randomly selected papers from 496 journals and compared the facets of movement studied with a suggested framework for movement ecology, consisting of internal state (motivation, physiology), motion and navigation capacities, and external factors (both the physical environment and living organisms), and links among these components. Most studies simply measured and described the movement of organisms without reference to ecological or internal factors, and the most frequently studied part of the framework was the link between external factors and motion capacity. Few studies looked at the effects on movement of navigation capacity, or internal state, and those were mainly from vertebrates. For invertebrates and plants most studies were at the population level, whereas more vertebrate studies were conducted at the individual level. Consideration of only population-level averages promulgates neglect of between-individual variation in movement, potentially hindering the study of factors controlling movement. Terminology was found to be inconsistent among taxa and subdisciplines. The gaps identified in coverage of movement studies highlight research areas that should be addressed to fully understand the ecology of movement. {\textcopyright} 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract = {The Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem in the northern Rocky Mountains provides the context for a natural experiment to investigate the response of consumers to resources with differing spatial and temporal dispersion regimes. Grey wolves (Canis lupus) and human hunters both provide resource subsidies to scavengers by provisioning them with the remains of their kills. Carrion from hunter kills is highly aggregated in time and space whereas carrion from wolf kills is more dispersed in both time and space. We estimated the total amount of carrion consumed by each scavenger species at both wolf and hunter kills over 4 years. Species with large feeding radii [bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) and ravens (Corpus corax)], defined as the area over which a consumer can efficiently locate and integrate resources, dominated consumption at the highly aggregated hunter kills whereas competitively dominant species [coyotes (Canis latrans)] dominated at the more dispersed wolf kills. In addition, species diversity and the evenness of carrion consumption between scavengers was greater at wolf kills than at hunter kills while the total number of scavengers at hunter kills exceeded those at wolf kills. From a community perspective, the top-down effect of predation is likely to be stronger in the vicinity of highly aggregated resource pulses as species with large feeding radii switch to feeding on alternative prey once the resource pulse subsides.},

abstract = {This paper provides a taxonomic review of the titi monkeys, genus Callicebus, and describes two new species from central Brazilian Amazonia, Callicebus bernhardi and Callicebus stephennashi. Previous revisions include Hershkovitz (1988, 1990), Kobayashi (1995), Kobayashi and Langguth (1999) and Groves (1993, 2001). Here we arrange the titi monkeys, genus Callicebus Thomas, 1903, into five Species Groups or clades, and a total of 28 species. The Callicebus donacophilus Group is represented by the following species: Callicebus modestus L{\"{o}}nnberg, 1939, Callicebus donacophilus (d'Orbigny, 1836), Callicebus pallescens Thomas, 1907 (treated by Hershkovitz as a subspecies of C. donacophilus), Callicebus olallae L{\"{o}}nnberg,1939, and Callicebus oenanthe Thomas, 1924. The Callicebus moloch Group is represented by the following species: Callicebus cinerascens (Spix, 1823), Callicebus hoffmannsi Thomas, 1908, Callicebus baptista L{\"{o}}nnberg, 1939 (treated by Hershkovitz as a subspecies of C. hoffmannsi), Callicebus brunneus (Wagner, 1842), Callicebus moloch (Hoffmannsegg, 1807), and the new species here described as Callicebus bernhardi. The Callicebus cupreus Group is represented by the following species: Callicebus cupreus (Spix, 1823), Callicebus discolor (I. Geoffroy {\&} Deville, 1848) (treated by Hershkovitz as a subspecies of C. cupreus), Callicebus ornatus (Gray, 1866) (treated by Hershkovitz as a subspecies of Callicebus cupreus), Callicebus caligatus (Wagner, 1842), Callicebus dubius Hershkovitz, 1988, and the new species here described as Callicebus stephennashi. The Callicebus torquatus Group is represented by the following species: Callicebus torquatus (Hoffmannsegg, 1807), Callicebus lugens (Humboldt, 1811) (treated by Hershkovitz as a subspecies of C. torquatus), Callicebus purinus Thomas, 1927 (treated by Hershkovitz as a subspecies of C. torquatus), Callicebus lucifer Thomas, 1914 (treated by Hershkovitz as a subspecies of C. torquatus), Callicebus regulus Thomas, 1927 (treated by Hershkovitz as a subspecies of C. torquatus), and Callicebus medemi Hershkovitz, 1963 (treated by Hershkovitz as a subspecies of C. torquatus). The Callicebus personatus Group is treated separately from the Callicebus moloch Group and is represented by the following species: Callicebus personatus ({\'{E}}. Geoffroy, 1812), Callicebus melanochir (Wied-Neuwied, 1820) (treated by Hershkovitz as a subspecies of C. personatus), Callicebus nigrifrons (Spix, 1823) (treated by Hershkovitz as a subspecies of C. personatus), Callicebus barbarabrownae Hershkovitz, 1990 (treated by Hershkovitz as a subspecies of C. personatus), and Callicebus coimbrai Kobayashi {\&} Langguth, 1999. Callicebus bernhardi was discovered in the Rio Aripuan{\~{a}} basin in 1996 by M. G. M. van Roosmalen, who also discovered Callicebus stephennashi in 2001, while traveling on the Rio Purus. The geographic distributions of all hitherto recognized Callicebus species are updated, and the validity of the river barrier hypothesis for titis and other Amazonian primates is discussed, along with their conservation status.},

abstract = {The use of the habitat by the neotropical river otter was studied using indirect evidence in the lower Roble river. From August 2006 until March 2007, walks were taken along a 5 kilometer stretch of river, and 5 m of the river bank were examined on each side, with repetition every 15 days, in search for signs of the neotropical river otter. The terrestrial and aquatic habitat was characterized every 400 m and a vegetation coverage map was elaborated. The landascape matrix is dominated by pasture used for cattle grazing, followed by secondary and mixed forests and Guadua angustifoli forests, which are the dominant species, presenting abundant shrubbery and fallen logs that provide camouflage and refuge for the otter. The otter prefers territory marking sites in the summer (dry) season (January- March), rocks emerging from the stream, and the determining characteristics for choosing such rocks was size, height, bank proximity, and vegetation coverage (r2 = 20.44; cp = 2.151, n = 10). Whereas during the winter (wet) season (October - December), smaller rocks, yet high enough to avoid the stream during a rise in the water level, were chosen by the otter (r2 conservation of the species},

abstract = {In Neotropical forests, mammals act as seed dispersers and predators. To prevent seed predation and promote dispersal, seeds exhibit physical or chemical defenses. Collared peccaries (Pecari tajacu) cannot eat some hard seeds, but can digest chemically defended seeds. Central American agoutis (Dasyprocta punctata) gnaw through hard-walled seeds, but cannot consume chemically defended seeds. The objectives of this study were to determine relative peccary and agouti abundances within a lowland forest in Costa Rica and to assess how these two mammals affect the survival of large seeds that have no defenses (Iriartea deltoidea, Socratea exorrhiza), physical defenses (Astrocaryum alatum, Dipteryx panamensis), or chemical defenses (Mucuna holtonii) against seed predators. Mammal abundances were determined over 3 yrs from open-access motion-detecting camera trap photos. Using semi-permeable mammal exclosures and thread-marked seeds, predation and dispersal by mammals for each seed species were quantified. Abundances of peccaries were up to six times higher than those of agoutis over 3 yrs, but neither peccary nor agouti abundances differed across years. Seeds of A. alatum were predominantly dispersed by peccaries, which did not eat A. alatum seeds, whereas non-defended and chemically defended seeds suffered high levels of predation, mostly by peccaries. Agoutis did not eat M. holtonii seeds. Peccaries and agoutis did not differ in the distances they dispersed seeds. This study shows that seed fates are contingent upon many factors such as seed defenses, frugivore–granivore abundances, and seed-handling capabilities. Mammal–seed interactions are complex; the outcomes of these interactions depend on the inherent characteristics of seeds and their potential dispersers.},

abstract = {Building useful models of species distributions requires attention to several important issues, one being imperfect detection of species. Data sets of species detections are likely to suffer from false absence records. Depending on the type of survey, false positive records can also be a problem. Disregarding these observation errors may lead to important biases in model estimation as well as overconfidence about precision. The severity of the problem depends on the intensity of these errors and how they correlate with environmental characteristics (e.g. where species detectability strongly depends on habitat features). A powerful modelling framework that accounts for imperfect detection in the modelling of species distributions has developed in the last 10–15 yr. Fundamental to this framework is that data must be collected in a way that is informative about the observation process. For instance, such data can be in the form of multiple detection/non-detection records obtained from several visits/observers/detection methods at (at least) some of the sites, or from data on times to detection within a survey visit. The framework can extend to studying species' range dynamics and the modelling of communities, as well as approaches for analysing data on abundance and multiple occupancy states (rather than binary presence/absence). This paper summarizes these modelling advances, discusses evidence about effects of imperfect detection and the difficulties of working with it, and concludes with the current outlook for future research and application of these methods.},

abstract = {Mammal inventories in tropical forests are often difficult to carry out, and many elusive species are missed or only reported from interviews with local people. Camera traps offer a new tool for conducting inventories of large- and medium-sized terrestrial mammals. We evaluated the efficiency of camera traps based on data from two surveys carried out at a single site during 2 consecutive years. The survey efforts were 1440 and 2340 camera days, and 75 and 86{\%} of the 28 large- and medium-sized terrestrial mammal species known to occur at the site were recorded. Capture frequencies for different species were highly correlated between the surveys, and the capture probability for animals that passed in front of the cameras decreased with decreasing size of the species. Camera spacing and total survey area had little influence on the number of species recorded, with survey effort being the main factor determining the number of recorded species. Using a model we demonstrated the exponential increase in survey effort required to record the most elusive species. We evaluated the performance of different species richness estimators on this dataset and found the Jackknife estimators generally to perform best. We give recommendations on how to increase efficiency of camera trap surveys exclusively targeted at species inventories.},

abstract = {Cities play an important role in the global carbon cycle. They produce a large proportion of CO 2 emissions, but they also sequester and store carbon in urban forests and green space. However, sequestration by urban green space is difficult to quantify and also involves emissions. The carbon footprint analysis is an established method for systematically quantifying carbon sinks and sources throughout the lifetime of goods and services. We applied this method to an urban green space project in Leipzig, Germany. To the best of our knowledge it is the first application in this field. We simulated carbon sequestration by growing trees and contrasted it with all related carbon sources, from construction and maintenance over the lifetime of 50 years. In addition, we explored alternative design and maintenance scenarios. Total net sequestration was predicted to be between 137 and 162MgCO 2ha -1. Park-like design and maintenance is less effective than forest-like design and maintenance. Much uncertainty is linked to tree growth and tree mortality. Increasing annual tree mortality from 0.5 to 4{\%} reduces sequestration by over 70{\%}. In conclusion, urban green space can act as a carbon sink and the design and maintenance have a strong influence on the carbon footprint. The carbon footprint analysis is a valuable tool for estimating the long-term environmental performance of urban green space projects. Compared to emissions from people, the overall potential for carbon mitigation is limited, even in cities such as Leipzig with widely available space for new urban green space. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = { A study of habitat use of two sympatric brocket deer species was conducted by recording dung and tracks along 40 km traits cleared through four vegetation types in the chaco-cerrado border of Santa Cruz Department, Bolivia. Deer signs of each species were characterized and discriminated by size and shape and counted for each habitat (transitional chaco forest, chiquitano riverine forest, chiquitano moist piedmont forest and cerrado open woodland) by walking 180-km in the wet season and 90-km in the dry season. The four habitats showed differences in vegetation structure and plant composition (canopy height and cover, horizontal visibility, and fruit resources) as well as frequency of signs for each brocket deer species. Although red brocket signs were less abundant than gray brocket signs, for both species and in every habitat we found consistently more tracks than dung in the wet season, and more dung than tracks in the dry season. Dung and track counts indicated that gray brockets were common and widespread in the four habitats, while reds occurred mostly in piedmont and riverine forest. Daily activity hours recorded by camera trapping showed that red brockets were active mostly from sunset until sunrise (6 pm to 6 am: 87{\%} of 32 events) and gray brockets mostly in the morning (5 am to 10 am: 66{\%} of 87 events). patterns of habitat use and daily activity suggest that these sympatric deer species segregate in space and time. A comparative study of their diet, plus more behavioral data from sympatric and allopatric situations are needed to better understand the way in which deer may partition resources.},

abstract = {The Amazon forest has been converted to a matrix of pristine and modified habitats. Landscape-scale biodiversity conservation requires an understanding of species' distributions over this matrix to guarantee both effective protection and use for present and future generations. In this study, we evaluated how much of the existing and future planned protected areas (PAs) would be contributing to the conservation of Brazilian Amazon mammals (N = 399), including threatened species (N = 51). Currently, almost 37{\%} of Brazilian Amazon is protected and that may increase to 46{\%} if planned PAs are implemented. In the current PA system, 22{\%} are indigenous land and 11{\%} are sustainable use units, e.g., production forests. Only one-fifth of the whole range of mammal species occurring in Brazilian Amazon is actually protected by Brazilian PAs. However, considering only the part of the ranges within the Brazilian Amazon, and therefore under the scope of Brazilian actions, Brazilian PAs assume an important role in the protection of 39{\%} of mammal distribution ranges, particularly the threatened species (39{\%}). These results suggest that an integrated network of protected areas among Amazon countries would be necessary to increase their efficiency in mammal conservation. The need for strengthening of the forest sector and good management practices in Brazil appears critical for the maintenance of large extents of forest and species conservation. Under such a scenario, the contribution of developed nations and international agencies must assume an important role for the maintenance and enlargement of the protected area network in Amazon region.

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Seed dispersal ecology of Bactris acanthocarpa Mart. (Arecaceae), an Atlantic forest understory palm, was investigated during two years as an attempt to test the following predictions: (i) seeds of Bactris are dispersed by mammals and large-gaped birds; (ii) Bactris benefits from seed dispersal in terms of seed predation avoidance, improvement of seed germination and seedling survival; and (iii) spatial distribution of adults is related to patterns of seed dispersal. The study was conducted at Dois Irm??os Reserve, a 387.4-ha reserve of Atlantic forest in northeastern Brazil (8?? S-35?? W). Black-rumped agoutis (Dasyprocta prymnolopha) and Guianan squirrels (Sciurus aestuans) were identified as the seed dispersers/predators, moving seeds short distances ({\textless} 4 m from parents) and at low rates (0.04-0.05 diaspore/palm/day). Pyrene burial prevented seed predation by vertebrates and reduced by half seed infestation by Scolytidae beetles. Only buried pyrenes germinated. Pyrene predation was not correlated with distance from conspecific adults. In contrast, early seedling mortality was higher near conspecific adults. Most adults (64{\%}) had their nearest conspecific adult neighbour {\textgreater} 4 m away in contrast to 96{\%} of seedlings that occurred concentrated within 4 m from adults (77{\%} under the palm crowns). Here, we present evidence that spatial distribution of B. acanthocarpa is partly due to low rates of seed removal, short-distance seed dispersal by agoutis and squirrels, and early seedling mortality associated with presence of seedlings under palm crowns. ?? 2001 ??ditions scientifiques et m??dicales Elsevier SAS.},

Thus, some studies indicate that a portion of these run-over incidents may be intentional and could be avoided. We investigated whether various groups of small animals had different run-over rates and how “charisma” affects the survival chances of an animal on the roads. During our experiment, we quantiied run-over rates for models of spiders, snakes, chicks, and tree leaves (control) on three roads with different trafic volumes. We found out that snakes and spiders were consistently ran over with a higher frequency than chicks and leaves. We also observed that chicks were the only models rescued by human beings. We concluded that the survival chances of chicks are the highest among the models tested and this is due to the charismatic value attributed to them by human beings, when compared to snakes and spiders. We suggest the broadcasting of campaigns in the media to increase public awareness regarding wildlife conservation as a useful tool to solve the problem of intentional run over of small animals.},

abstract = {Birds are common predators of arthropods in many ecosystems but their impact on spiders has not been assessed. Therefore, the experimental evidence for bird predation effects on spider populations was examined. In particular, the present review focuses on the questions: what are the ecological mechanisms and what are the evolutionary consequences? Data from 17 field experiments, mainly in forest ecosystems, showed that spider communities were often significantly affected by bird predation. Comparisons of experimental effects were based on the ratio of mean density on experimentally enclosed vegetation and on controls. In 27 tests, a significant effect was detected (mean ratio 3.03) but in 9 tests the effect was nonsignificant (mean ratio 1.03). Furthermore, field experimental studies on bird predation effects on certain spider species or certain genera were reviewed. In three investigations, significant predation effects were found on agelenid, linyphiid and theridiid spiders but there were no significant effects on lycosids. Selective bird predation on large individuals has been shown in studies on spider communities and single species. Data on bird predation effects on species richness were lacking although impact on large species was expected to be important. Three field experiments showed that different spider families may experience differences in bird predation pressure. An aviary experiment showed that frequently moving spiders had a higher risk of predation than sedentary individuals, but the evidence from field experiments supporting the hypothesis of high predation pressure on moving spiders was limited. This included sex-specific differences in size and movement, although at least one experiment showed that males had higher winter mortality than females. One experiment showed that bird predation can affect anti-predator behavior. In conclusion, the present evidence showed that bird predation on spiders in several contrasting forest ecosystems is strong. However, there are many hypotheses regarding bird predation on spider populations that should be examined in future field experiments.},

abstract = {This manuscript presents information about the ecology of Lontra longicaudis (Olfers, 1818) in the Taquari Valley, State of Rio Grande do Sul, southern Brazil. The study was carried out in two areas located in the Forquetinha Creek and in the Forqueta River from January to December 2003. The otters are specialist feeders (Bsta = 0.24), with a diet based mostly on fish, especially those of the families Loricariidae and Cichlidae. Most shelters used by the species were excavated burrows underneath tree roots, while shelters within rocks were used less frequently. The burrows showed great variation in size, being found on average 3.5 m (sd = 3.6 m) away from the margin and 2.5 m (sd = 1.2 m) above the water level. Scent marks were made preferentially on rocks and fallen tree trunks at the edge of the water. There was a tendency to increase the reutilization of latrines in detriment of using new sites throughout the sample period.O presente estudo apresenta dados sobre a ecologia de Lontra longicaudis (Olfers, 1818) no Vale do Taquari, sul do Brasil.

abstract = {. The diet of the Neotropical otter Lontra longicaudis  (Olfers, 1818) is one of the best known aspects of its biology throughout its distribution range. However, most dietary studies have been undertaken during short time periods, making it difficult to identify temporal patterns in the feeding behavior of the species. The present study aimed to describe the diet of L. longicaudis in the lower region of the Mambucaba Catchment, state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, during a three year period, based on analyses of spraints (feces). The results show fish as the main prey item (frequency of occurrence, FO = 85.78{\%}), as already described in previous studies. Crustaceans were the second main prey (FO = 70.67{\%}), occurring in the spraints during the whole year, however presenting a higher frequency of occurrence than fish in samples collected during some months. Anurans were the third most important prey item (FO = 9.56{\%}) and mammals, birds and reptiles were preyed upon only rarely (less than 4{\%}). Fish and crustaceans were present in the diet of the species throughout the year and frogs were important mostly from June to August (dry season). This higher rate of predation on amphibians during the drier months was probably related to the decrease of the main prey.},

abstract = {The pampas deer is an endangered South American species which occurs in open grasslands and savannas. This aim of this survey was to evaluate the use of the distance sampling technique to estimate densities of the species in the Pantanal wetland, as well as to analyze the applicability of the method for a monitoring program. The surveys were conducted on roads from vehicles and also on foot along 26 parallel transects in November 1999 and 2000 at Campo Dora ranch, south-central Pantanal, Brazil. Deer densities were estimated using the program DISTANCE, and the program MONITOR was used to run a power analysis to estimate the probability of detection of a decline in the population. The deer density estimated from vehicles, with data from both years, was 9.813.8 individual/km2, and 5.530.68 individuals/km2 from transects sampled on foot. The power analysis of these data revealed a monitoring program would require at least two surveys per year over seven years to obtain a 90{\%} chance of detecting a 5{\%} decline in the population. Our results also indicate surveys from roads are not recommended for pampas deer counts as the animals appear to keep a relatively safe distance from cars.},

abstract = {The effect of seed aggregation and distance from conspecific trees on seed predation was experimentally examined for two neotropical tree species, Macoubea guianensis (Apocynaceae) and Pourteria sp. (Sapotaceae) in a lowland tropical rain forest in northeastern Peru. Results of these experiments are discussed in the context of the Janzen-Connell model (Janzen 1970; Connell 1971), which predicts decreased seed survival near parent trees due to either density- or distance-responsive mortality, and Howe's model (Howe 1989) which predicts that trees with seeds dispersed in clumps (aggregated) will not suffer density-dependent predation, and will have higher survival of seeds near the parent tree than other trees. We also examined whether predation on seeds of these species was affected by seed placement in or near 30-m-wide strips regenerating after clear-cutting. Both species appeared to be mammal-dispersed but differed in how frugivores handled seeds, seed size, overall fruit crop size, and gemination time. Neither of the two species studied appeared to suffer seed predation in a manner predicted by the Janzen-Connell model, and patterns of seed predation for only one of the species was similar to predictions of Howe's model. For neither species did seed predation along the edge of, or in the center of, regenerating clear cuts differ from predation 15 m into the primary forest. For Pouteria, seed predation in and near regnerating strips was significantly greater than around forest trees, but the opposite pattern held for Macouben. Overall, seed predation was much greater on Macouben. The difference in seed predation for these two species was most likely a result of differences in the types of seed predators that attacked these two species.},

abstract = {Background: The largest terrestrial species in the order Carnivora are wide-ranging and rare because of their positions at the top of food webs. They are some of the world's most admired mammals and, ironically, some of the most imperiled. Most have experienced substantial population declines and range contractions throughout the world during the past two centuries. Because of the high metabolic demands that come with endothermy and large body size, these carnivores often require large prey and expansive habitats. These food requirements and wide-ranging behavior often bring them into confl ict with humans and livestock. This, in addition to human intolerance, renders them vulnerable to extinction. Large carnivores face enormous threats that have caused massive declines in their populations and geographic ranges, including habitat loss and degradation, persecution, utilization, and depletion of prey. We highlight how these threats can affect the conservation status and ecological roles of this planet's 31 largest carnivores. Advances: Based on empirical studies, trophic cascades have been documented for 7 of the 31 largest mammalian carnivores (not including pinnipeds). For each of these species (see fi gure), human actions have both caused declines and contributed to recovery, providing "natural experiments" for quantifying their effects on food-web and community structure. Large carnivores deliver economic and ecosystem services via direct and indirect pathways that help maintain mammal, avian, invertebrate, and herpetofauna abundance or richness. Further, they affect other ecosystem processes and conditions, such as scavenger subsidies, disease dynamics, carbon storage, stream morphology, and crop production. The maintenance or recovery of ecologically effective densities of large carnivores is an important tool for maintaining the structure and function of diverse ecosystems. Outlook: Current ecological knowledge indicates that large carnivores are necessary for the maintenance of biodiversity and ecosystem function. Human actions cannot fully replace the role of large carnivores. Additionally, the future of increasing human resource demands and changing climate will affect biodiversity and ecosystem resiliency. These facts, combined with the importance of resilient ecosystems, indicate that large carnivores and their habitats should be maintained and restored wherever possible. Preventing the extinction of these species and the loss of their irreplaceable ecological function and importance will require novel, bold, and deliberate actions. We propose a Global Large Carnivore Initiative to coordinate local, national, and international research, conservation, and policy.},

abstract = {Context: Objective identification of locations on transportation networks, where animal-vehicle collisions (AVC) occur more frequently than expected (hotspots), is an important step for the effective application of mitigation measures. Objectives: We introduce the KDE+ software which is a programmed version of the KDE+ method for effective identification of traffic accident hotspots. The software can be used in order to analyze animal-vehicle collision data. Methods: The KDE+ method is based on principles of Kernel Density Estimation (KDE). The symbol ‘+' indicates that the method allows for the objective selection of significant clusters and for the ranking of the hotspots. It is also simultaneously applicable to an unlimited number of road segments. Results: We applied the KDE+ method to the entire Czech road network. The hotspots were ranked according to their significance. The resulting hotspots represent a short overall road length which should require a more detailed assessment in the field. The 100 most important clusters of AVC represent, for example, only 19.7 km of the entire road network (37,469 km). Conclusions: We present an objective method for hotspots identification which can be used for AVC data. This method is unique because it determines the significance level of hotspots in an objective way. The prioritization of hotspots allows a transportation manager to effectively allocate resources to a feasible number of identified hotspots. We describe the software, data preparation and present the KDE+ application to AVC data. {\textcopyright} 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

Simulated roadkill were positioned over a 1 km distance, and trials were conducted at eight different speeds (20-100 km{\textperiodcentered}h{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}). The recommended protocol was then tested on a 100-km transect, driven daily over a 40-day period. This recorded 413 vertebrate roadkill, comprising 106 species. We recommend the protocol be adopted for future road ecology studies to enable robust statistical comparisons between studies. Previous assessments of wildlife road mortality have not used directly comparable methods and, at present, there is no standardized protocol for the collection of such data. Consequently, there are no internationally comparative statistics documenting roadkill rates. In this study, we used a combination of experimental trials and road transects to design a standardized protocol to assess roadkill rates on both paved and unpaved roads.},

abstract = {Pseudoreplication is defined. as the use of inferential statistics to test for treatment effects with data from experiments where either treatments are not replicated (though samples may be) or replicates are not statistically independent. In ANOVA terminology, it is the testing for treatment effects with an error term inappropriate to the hypothesis being considered. Scrutiny of 176 experi-mental studies published between 1960 and the present revealed that pseudoreplication occurred in 27{\%} of them, or 48{\%} of all such studies that applied inferential statistics. The incidence of pseudo-replication is especially high in studies of marine benthos and small mammals. The critical features of controlled experimentation are reviewed. Nondemonic intrusion is defined as the impingement of chance events on an experiment in progress. As a safeguard against both it and preexisting gradients, interspersion of treatments is argued to be an obligatory feature of good design. Especially in small experiments, adequate interspersion can sometimes be assured only by dispensing with strict random-ization procedures. Comprehension of this conflict between interspersion and randomization is aided by distinguishing pre-layout (or conventional) and layout-specifit alpha (probability of type I error). Suggestions are offered to statisticians and editors of ecological j oumals as to how ecologists' under-standing of experimental design and statistics might be improved.},

abstract = {Humans hunt forest vertebrates throughout the tropics. Many preferred game species consume flowers, fruit, seeds and/or leaves, and these interactions will cause their harvest to ramify through forests. Three related issues will determine how severely the harvest of forest vertebrates influences the plant community. First, the types of species selected by hunters and the intensity of the harvest will determine which vertebrates are removed and which remain. Second, the possible presence of ecologically similar, non-game species able to expand their activities to fulfill the ecological role of heavily exploited species will determine how severely the harvest disrupts ecological relationships between the community of forest vertebrates and the community of forest plants. Finally, hunters will alter plant species composition if the harvest of vertebrates differentially affects mutualists or pests of particular plant species. Hunters will also alter plant diversity if the harvest of vertebrates disrupts ecological mechanisms that permit plant species to coexist. I examine hunter selectivity, the intensity of the hunt, possible compensation by non-game species, and the types and strengths of interactions among game species and plants for tropical forests to determine when and where these outcomes occur.},

We surveyed trails in Glacier National Park for bear tracks and scats during five consecutive years. Using these data, we modeled the occurrence of bear sign on trails, then estimated the power of various sampling schemes. Specifically, we explored the power of bear sign surveys to detect a 20{\%} decline in sign occurrence. Realistic sampling schemes appear feasible if the density of sign is high enough, and we provide guidelines for designs with adequate replication to monitor long-term trends of dispersed populations using sign occurrences on trails.},

abstract = {Many plant species are threatened as a result of extinction of their large-bodied frugivores all over the world. Additionally, introduced herbivores and seed predators may cause severe pressure on early stages of plant recruitment. We studied the seed dispersal and seed predation of the keystone palm Euterpe edulis on a land-bridge island with a highly impoverished frugivore fauna and overabundant seed predators, and in a continuous Atlantic forest in Brazil. While the diversity of avian seed dispersers and predators was higher on the mainland, the abundance of seed dispersers was 4-fold higher on the island. Turdus flavipes was responsible for 72{\%} and 96{\%} of seeds removed in the island and mainland, respectively. However, the higher density of T. flaviceps on the island did not result in higher seed removal. In fact, seed removal rate was 1.7 times lower there than on the mainland, probably due to the aggressive behavior of the major seed disperser who defend palm fruits. Seed predation, on the other hand, was markedly higher on the island, where nearly 100{\%} of seeds were preyed upon, but only 0.3{\%} on the mainland. As a consequence of higher seed predation the population of E. edulis has few numbers of seedlings and saplings on the island. Therefore, management of the seed predator populations on the island is a key priority for recovering the natural population of this keystone palm and the frugivores that depend on its fruits. ?? 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS.

abstract = {Capuchin monkey behavior has been the focus of increasing numbers of captive and field studies in recent years, clarifying behavioral and ecological differences between the two morphological types: the gracile and the robust capuchins (also referred to as untufted and tufted). Studies have tended to focus on the gracile species Cebus capucinus (fewer data are available for C. albifrons, C. olivaceus, and C. kaapori) and on Cebus apella, a name that has encompassed all of the robust capuchins since the 1960s. As a result, it is difficult to ascertain the variation within either gracile or robust types. The phylogenetic relationships between gracile and robust capuchins have also, until now, remained obscure. Recent studies have suggested two independent Pliocene radiations of capuchins stemming from a common ancestor in the Late Miocene, about 6.2 millions of years ago (Ma). The present-day gracile capuchins most likely originated in the Amazon, and the robust capuchins in the Atlantic Forest to the southeast. Sympatry between the two types is explained by a recent expansion of robust capuchins into the Amazon (ca. 400,000 years ago). Morphological data also support a division of capuchins into the same two distinct groups, and we propose the division of capuchin monkeys into two genera, Sapajus Kerr, 1792, for robust capuchins and Cebus Erxleben, 1777, for gracile capuchins, based on a review of extensive morphological, genetic, behavioral, ecological, and biogeographic evidence.},

abstract = {Recently, the focus of conservation efforts gradually changed from a species-centred approach to a broader ambition of conserving functional ecosystems. This new approach relies on the understanding that much ecosystem function is a result of the interaction of species to form complex interaction networks. Therefore measures summarising holistic attributes of such ecological networks have the potential to provide useful indicators to guide and assess conservation objectives. The most generally accepted insight is that complexity in species interactions, measured by network connectance, is an important attribute of healthy communities which usually protects them from secondary extinctions. An implicit and overlooked corollary to this generalization is that conservation efforts should be directed to conserve highly connected communities. We conducted a literature review to search for empirical evidence of a relationship between connectance (complexity) and conservation value (communities on different stages of degradation). Our results show that the often assumed positive relationship between highly connected and desirable (i.e. with high conservation value) communities does not derive from empirical data and that the topic deserves further discussion. Given the conflicting empirical evidence revealed in this study, it is clear that connectance on its own cannot provide clear information about conservation value. In the face of the ongoing biodiversity crisis, studies of species interaction networks should incorporate the different 'conservation value' of nodes (i.e. species) in a network if it is to be of practical use in guiding and evaluating conservation practice. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Six Atlantic forest fragments ranging in size from 210 to 24,000 ha were surveyed for hunted species of mammals and birds. Nocturnal and diurnal censuses were carried out on a total of 460 km of trails during 18 months in the six sites. Of the species traditionally hunted in the Atlantic Forest, 12 species of mammals and 9 of birds were recorded in the region, being the most abundant the capuchin monkey (Cebus apella robustus), the agouti (Dasyprocta leporina), the brocket deer (Mazama spp.) among mammals, and the common guan (Penelope superciliaris), the red-billed curassow (Crax blumenbachii), and the wood-quail (Odontophorus capueira) among birds. As expected from the species-area relationship, the larger fragments had the richest communities, including rare species such as the giant armadillo (Priodontes maximus), and large-sized species like tapirs (Tapirus terrestris), and peccaries (Pecari tajacu and Tayassu pecari) which, however, were extinct in the fragments of small size. Direct (encounter with hunters, dogs, shots listened) and indirect evidences (traps, hunting devices and trails, etc.) of the action of hunters were observed in all sites, indicating that illegal hunting is a common practice both in private as well as state reserves administered by IBAMA. However, the comparison of the encounter rate with hunted species among the six sites demonstrated that the abundance of mammals and birds were significantly higher in Linhares Forest Reserve (CVRD), a result of this reserve's efficient surveillance apparatus. The long term survivorship of these species is questioned, as populations remaining in fragments are already small and isolated, making them highly susceptible to extinction even under slight hunting pressure},

The defensive behaviour of the species is determined to be based primarily on the avoidance of conflict situations, with overt aggressive behaviour seldom displayed. Although the opportunistic existence that this species has developed is probably obligatory due to their sedentary lifestyle and limited availability of resources, this behaviour nonetheless allows the species to occupy diverse habitats and exploit niches unavailable to more specialized species.},

The extant Latin American deer are the most diverse deer assemblage in the world (Cervinae: one genus, one species: Elk [Cervus elaphus]; Odocoilineae: six genera, 18 species: White-tailed deer [Odocoileus virginianus], mule deer [O. hemionus], marsh deer [Blastocerus dochotomus], pampas deer [Ozotoceros bezoarticus], huemul [Hippocamelus bisulcus], taruca [Hippocamelus antisensis], greater pudu [Pudu mephistophiles], lesser pudu [Pudu pudu], and six recognized species of brocket deer [Mazama americana, M. gouazoubira, M. nana, M. bricenni, M. chunyi, and M. rufina] as well as three recently proposed species [M. pandora, M. rondoni, and M. bororo]). Within this group, three genera (Odocoileus, Hippocamelus, and Blastocerus) have been well studied, whereas the genus Mazama, P. puda, P. mephistophiles, and H. antisensis have received little attention. The marsh deer, pampas deer, taruca, huemul, lesser pudu, and two Mazama species (Mazama nana and M. bororo) are the most endangered species. They are each listed as Convention International for the Trade of Endangered Species Appendix I and are considered by the International Union for Nature Conservation to be near threatened or endangered. We updated or created distribution maps for these species. Current research predominantly centres on easily available species (e.g., white-tailed deer in Mexico) or endangered species (e.g., marsh deer in Brazil). In contrast, the ecology and conservation status of the pudu, taruca, and Mazama sp. remain largely unknown.},

abstract = {The coexistence of many species in plant communities is difficult to explain because plants use a priori the same resources. After several decades of theoretical and empirical work many mechanisms have been proved to foster plant coexistence. Using the bibliography we classify these mechanisms according to three criteria. (1) Mechanisms of coexistence are equalising, i.e. they diminish the fitness differences between species, or stabilising, i.e. they insure that a species driven to a very low density can again invade a plant community. Only stabilising mechanisms promote stable coexistence. (2) Stabilising mechanisms are always based on the partitioning of a resource, which ultimately reduce to space or time. (3) Both exogenous and endogenous processes are sources of heterogeneity and variability which enable coexistence through space and time partitioning. Processes involved in endogenous heterogeneity enable coexistence in many ways because niches and differentiation of niches between species are selfgenerated at the same time by plant communities. Although most mechanisms of plant coexistence have probably been discovered, four questions should be still addressed: Is there a link between mechanisms of coexistence and ecosystem functioning and community stability? Which mechanisms dominate real communities? How stable is coexistence in real communities? How do mechanisms of coexistence and evolution interact?},

abstract = {Statistical Design and Analysis of Experiments is intended to be a practitioner's guide to statistical methods for designing and analyzing experiments. The topics selected for inclusion in this book represent statistical techniques that we feel are most useful to experimenters and data analysts who must either collect, analyze, or interpret data. The material included in this book also was selected to be of value to managers, supervisors, and other administrators who must make decisions based in part on the analyses of data that may have been performed by others. The intended audience for this book consists of two groups. The first group covers a broad spectrum of practicing engineers and scientists, including those in supervisory positions, who utilize or wish to utilize statistical approaches to solving problems in an experimental setting. This audience includes those who have little formal training in statistics but who are motivated by indus- trial or academic experiences in laboratory or process experimentation. These practicing engineers and scientists should find the contents of this book to be self-contained, with little need for reference to other sources for background information. The second group for whom this book is intended is students in introduc- tory statistics courses in colleges and universities. This book is appropriate for courses in which statistical experimental design and the analysis of data are the main topics. It is appropriate for upper-level undergraduate or intro- ductory graduate-level courses, especially in disciplines for which the students have had or will have laboratory or similar data-collection experiences. The focus is on the use of statistical techniques, not on the theoretical underpin- nings of those techniques. College algebra is the only prerequisite. A limited amount of supplemental material makes use of vector and matrix operations, notably the coverage of multiple linear regression. This material has been placed in appendices and is not essential for an understanding of the methods and applications contained in this book. vii},

The definition of an optimum sample size is based on the idea that the larger the sample size, the greater the number of species in the sample, but the rate of increase becomes progressively smaller so the curve tends to a flat line. The point where the curve becomes horizontal is the minimal area to represent the plant community: the sampling sufficiency. This concept assumes that the plant community is a spacially discrete entity with fixed species composition. In tropical forests, the identification of communities boundaries is particularly difficult and, due to their high species richness, the species accumulation curves do not become flat, even with large sample sizes. The species accumulation curve is unsuitable to determine optimum sample size in tropical forests because these curves do not behave as expected, futhermore the concept of sampling sufficiency itself rests upon a problematic definition of plant community.},

abstract = {Agricultural encroachment into low-governance forest frontiers including vast tracts of hitherto unclaimed public lands and indigenous territories represents one of the most abrupt land-use transitions in tropical countries. This often results from spontaneous migration from more heavily-settled regions or direct subsidies from land redistribution programs prescribed by central-government policy. Here, we briefly review the spatial scale and environmental consequences of agrarian resettlement schemes in tropical forest countries, and explore the policy contradictions of competing government agencies in shaping conflicting rationales for either conservation or rural development. We focus on the largest tropical forest region on Earth, the Brazilian Amazon, which continues to attract one of the largest waves of land-tenured and landless migrant farmers from elsewhere in Brazil. We argue that the environmental and monetary costs associated with these resettlement schemes are rarely outweighed by the socioeconomic benefits accrued to translocated farmers. Land-use planning in lowland tropical forest regions like Amazonia would benefit from a truly integrated policy framework that bridges the divide between conflicting government sectors, particularly in relation to smallholder occupation of previously intact forest areas, which increasingly contributes with a significant fraction of deforestation in many regions. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Complete extirpation of a species can generate cascading effects throughout an ecosystem, yet are precisely the goal of island eradications of pest species. "Mesopredator release effect", an asymmetrical special case of intraguild predation, has been hypothesised as a possible indirect effect from eradications, where superpredator removal can generate a mesopredator increase which may increase the impact on their shared prey. Theoretically this suggests that for intraguild predators, the superpredator may protect the shared prey from mesopredation, and removal of superpredators alone is not recommended. We create a model of long-lived age-structured shared prey and explore the non-equilibrium dynamics of this system. The superpredator can impact all prey life-stages (adult survival and reproductive success) whereas the smaller mesopredator can only impact early life-stages (reproductive success). This model is independently tested with data from a closed oceanic island system where eradication of introduced intraguild predators is possible for conservation of threatened birds. Mesopredator release only occurs in strongly top-down moderated (resource-abundant) systems. Even when mesopredator release can occur, the negative impact of more mesopredators is outweighed by the benefit of superpredator removal, allowing recovery of the prey population. Results are robust to 10{\%} variation in model parameters. The consideration of age-structured prey contradicts previous theoretical results for mesopredator release effect and intraguild predation. Superpredator eradication is vital for population recovery of long-lived insular species. Nonetheless island conservation must retain a whole-ecosystem perspective given the complex trophic relationships among multiple species on islands. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The Neotropical otter Lontra longicaudis is a widespread semiaquatic carnivore living in a wide variety of environments in both fresh-water and salt-water ecosystems. We summarise the current knowledge on distribution, ecology, behaviour, evolution and conservation status of the species, and highlight the main threats that have been affecting it as well as priority actions for securing its survival. The current geographical range of Lontra longicaudis is discussed, as well as several efforts that have been made to update knowledge of the range. Throughout its known distribution area, the Neotropical otter has high genetic diversity, and recent molecular research suggests that variations in genetic diversity are related to geography. Taxonomic issues regarding the existence of subspecies persist, mainly due to limited sampling in key portions of the species' range. Although the Neotropical otter is widely distributed in Latin America and has flexible behaviour, it is subjected to a variety of threats, which lead this otter to be officially considered Threatened in several countries within its geographical range. The species still faces an uncertain future due to the impact of human activities, thus justifying its classification as Near Threatened in the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List. The real level of human-otter conflicts and the impact of modified environments on Neotropical otter populations are still unclear, and must be a priority focus of future studies. There is an urgent need to increase our knowledge on aspects of the Neotropical otter's biology, such as reproduction, generation time, behaviour, physiology, distribution limits, sanitary aspects, evolution and taxonomy. Understanding these topics is vital to ensure the long-term survival of the species, both at the local and at the regional scale, as well as to provide the basis for environmental education actions involving local riverside human communities.},

abstract = {Assessment was made of all available cranial specimens of wild Canis dating since the Blancan and prior to AD 1918 in the region east of the Great Plains and south of the Prairie Peninsula, Lakes Erie and Ontario, and the St. Lawrence River. The small wolf C. priscolatrans (= C. edwardii) of the early Irvingtonian seems unrelated to the modern red wolf (C. rufus), but gave rise to a lineage including the larger C. armbrusteri and culminating in C. dirus of the late Rancholabrean. A small wolf, possibly a descendant of the Eurasian C. mosbachensis, did not reappear in the east until near the end of the Rancholabrean. At the same time, the coyote (C. latrans) disappeared from the east, not to return until the small wolf was extirpated in the 20th century. Fragmentary remains of the small wolf, dating from around 10,000 and 2,000200 ybp, show continuity with 14 complete, mostly modern, eastern skulls. Multivariate analysis indicates those 14 represent a well-defined species, C. rufus, distinct from large series of the western gray wolf (C. lupus) and coyote. There is no evidence that the red wolf originated as a hybrid of the latter two species, though early specimens from central Texas suggest it began to interbreed with C. latrans by about 1900. Three long-recognized red wolf subspecies appear valid: C. r. floridanus, Maine to Florida; C. r. gregoryi, south-central United States; and C. r. rufus, central and coastal Texas, southern Louisiana, and probably now represented in the captive/reintroduced populations. The subspecies C. lupus lycaon of southeastern Ontario and southern Quebec is statistically intermediate to C. rufus and western C. lupus, and may have resulted from natural hybridization of those two species. Such could explain how the red and gray wolf differ so sharply where their ranges meet in the west but morphologically approach one another in the east. "},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {The establishment of plant species depends crucially on where the seeds are deposited. However, since most studies have been conducted in continuous forests, not much is known about the effects of forest fragmentation on the maintenance of abiotic and biotic characteristics in microhabitats and their effects on seed survival. In this study, we evaluated the effects of forest fragmentation on the predation upon the seeds of the palm Syagrus romanzoffiana in three microhabitats (interior forest, forest edge and gaps) in eight fragments of semi-deciduous Atlantic forest ranging in size from 9.5 ha to 33,845 ha in southeastern Brazil. Specifically, we examined the influence of the microhabitat structure, fauna and fragment size on the pattern of seed predation. Fragments {\textless}100 ha showed similar abiotic and biotic characteristics to those of the forest edge, with no seed predation in these areas. Forest fragments 230-380 ha in size did not present "safe sites" for S. romanzoffiana seed survival and showed high seed predation intensity in all microhabitats evaluated. In fragments larger than 1000 ha, the seed predation was lower, with abiotic and biotic differences among gaps, interior forests and forest edges. In these fragments, the survival of S. romanzoffiana seeds was related to squirrel abundance and interior forest maintenance. Based on these results, we concluded that there are no safe sites for S. romanzoffiana seed establishment in medium- and small-sized fragments as result of the biotic and abiotic pressure, respectively. We suggest that on these forest fragments, management plans are needed for the establishment of S. romanzoffiana, such as interior forest improvement and development in small-sized sites in order to minimize the edge effects, and on medium-sized fragments, we suggest post-dispersal seed protection in order to avoid seed predation by vertebrates. Our findings also stress the importance of assessing the influence of forest fragmentation on angiosperm reproductive biology as part of the effective planning for the management of fragmented areas. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Studies have typically employed species–area relationships (SARs) from sample areas to fit either the power relationship or the logarithmic (exponential) relationship. However, the plots from empirical data often fall between these models. This article proposes two complementary and hybrid models as solutions to the controversy regarding which model best fits sample-area SARs. Methods The two models are [...] The number of parameters is reduced from six to two by fixing the model at either end of the scale window of the data set, a step that is justified by the condition that the error or the bias, or both, in the first and the last data points is negligible. The new hybrid models as well as the power model and the logarithmic model are fitted to 10 data sets. Results The two proposed models fit well not only to Arrhenius' and Gleason's data sets, but also to the other six data sets. They also provide a good fit to data sets that follow a sigmoid (or triphasic) shape in log-log space and to data sets that do not fall between the power model and the logarithmic model. The logtransformation of the dependent variable, S, does not affect the curve fit appreciably, although it enhances the performance of the new models somewhat. Main conclusions Sample-area SARs have previously been shown to be convex upward, convex downward (concave), sigmoid and inverted sigmoid in log–log space. The new hybrid models describe successfully data sets with all these curve shapes, and should therefore produce good fits also to what are termed triphasic SARs},

Twelve lake perimeter sites were regularly checked for otter tracks and signs. The amount of signs was compared to environmental parameters to test their influence on otter presence and movements. A positive correlation was found between the amount of signs and the physical structure of the littoral areas, as well as vegetation structure. Lakeside otter presence decreased during the summer sampling throughout all sites. In order to determine otter diet, 205 spraints were examined. Otters fed mainly on fish (mostly Cichlidae), but also on crustaceans and molluscs. Other fish consumed were Characidae, Synbranchidae, Loricariidae and Erythrinidae. Seasonal variation was observed in diet composition: in summer, diet crustaceans and vertebrates other than fish increased. A higher percentage of benthic fish species was also observed in summer, while pelagic and benthopelagic species increased in winter. Such dietary changes may be explained by the different habitat use of otters in different seasons, from the lake coast (winter) towards more internal marshy areas of the wetland (summer).},

abstract = {The initial spatial pattern of seed deposition influences plant population and community structure, particularly when that pattern persists through recruitment. In a vertebrate-dispersed rain forest tree, Virola calophylla, we found that spatially aggregated seed deposition strongly influenced the spatial structure of later stages. Seed dispersion was clumped, and seed densities were highest underneath V. calophylla females and the sleeping sites of spider monkeys (Ateles paniscus), the key dispersal agent. Although these site types had the lowest per capita seed-to-seedling survival, they had the highest seedling/sapling densities. Conversely, seed and seedling/sapling densities were lowest, and seed survival was highest, at sites of diurnal seed dispersal by spider monkeys. Negative density-dependent and positive distance-dependent seed survival thinned seed clumps. Nonetheless, the clumped dispersion at sleeping and parental sites persisted to the seedling/sapling stage because differences in seed deposition were large enough to offset differences in seed survival among these site types.},

abstract = {Records of snakes are common in fauna road-kill monitoring studies in different Brazilian regions. To determine the intentionality of snake road-killing on a Brazilian road, the following hypotheses were tested: (1) more fake snakes are intentionally killed on the road than objects not similar to snakes; (2) the time elapsed until the first intentional fake snake road-kill is less than that for dissimilar objects; (3) the proportion of intentional collisions with fake snakes does not depend on the type of vehicle; (4) objects positioned in the center of the road are more frequently road-killed than those positioned on the roadside; (5) variation in the number of intentional road-kills is linked to variation of vehicular traffic. Fake snakes and PET bottles were placed in different positions on the MG-010 road (Minas Gerais State), and monitored for 96 hours by cameras that recorded the movement of vehicles on the lane. The numbers of intentional snake road-kills and control objects presented no differences, and the time elapsed until the first intentional road-kills was also similar. Cars and trucks are the vehicle categories with highest incidence of collisions. Objects were struck more often when positioned in the center of the road. This study proves that intentional road-killing occurs and that any small object on the road is subject to being struck by a moving vehicle. This behavior by some drivers on Brazilian roads may pose a threat to the conservation of species that venture onto these roads.},

abstract = {Dozens of publications, mostly in the last 45 years, have been devoted to nomenclatural problems concerning the status of the zoological nomina Hysaplesia, Hylaplesia, Dendrobates and related nomina. The Commission finally voted on this case in 2009, but this vote shows a misunderstanding of several of the problems at stake, as it contains a double and contradictory decision: the change in the type species of Hysaplesia and its suppression, although one only of these two acts would have been necessary and sufficient to solve this case, whereas taking them both together has other unforeseen and negative nomenclatural consequences. A final comprehensive solution to these nomenclatural problems is presented here, which does not require any more action from the Commission. However, the fact that the Commission, as well as the whole international community, have proved to be unable to understand fully the nomenclatural problems at stake and to solve them truthfully, while ignoring deliberately some contributions to the discussion, calls attention. This case suggests that there is a strong risk that nomenclature might become a domain where intellectual fairness and competence are secondary and where problems are ‘solved' through the medieval ‘Principle of Authority', through relying on the ‘opinions' of a few persons, committees or websites rather than on rational discussions based on a knowledge of taxonomic publications and an understanding of the Code. This course would result in dragging zoological nomenclature so to say outside the field of science and contribute to weakening still more a domain, taxonomy, which is already facing major problems, at the time of the crisis of biodiversity. Additional problems concerning taxonomic databases and websites are pointed out, and suggestions are offered in this respect, including the distinction between the concepts of ‘nomenclatural status' and ‘taxonomic status' of nomina.},

abstract = {Automatically triggered cameras taking photographs or videos of passing animals (camera traps) have emerged over the last decade as one of the most powerful tool for wildlife research. In parallel, a wealth of camera trap systems and models has become commercially available, a phenomenon mainly driven by the increased use of camera traps by sport hunters. This has raised the need for developing criteria to choose the suitable camera trap model in relation to a range of factors, primarily the study aim, but also target species, habitat, trapping site, climate and any other aspect that affects camera performance. There is also fragmented information on the fundamentals of sampling designs that deploy camera trapping, such as number of sampling sites, spatial arrangement and sampling duration. In this review, we describe the relevant technological features of camera traps and propose a set of the key ones to be evaluated when choosing camera models. These features are camera specifications such as trigger speed, sensor sensitivity, detection zone, flash type and flash intensity, power autonomy, and related specifications. We then outline sampling design and camera features for the implementation of major camera trapping applications, specifically: (1) faunal inventories, (2) occupancy studies, (3) density estimation through Capture-Mark-Recapture and (4) density estimation through the Random Encounter Model. We also review a range of currently available models and stress the need for standardized testing of camera models that should be frequently updated and widely distributed. Finally we summarize the "ultimate camera trap", as desired by wildlife biologists, and the current technological limitations of camera traps in relation to their potential for a number of emerging applications. {\textcopyright} 2013 Associazione Teriologica Italiana.},

The uniformity in species abundance evenness was higher in the native forest. In the Arauc ria reforestation area, ninety per cent of the collected individuals belonged only to two species. Results show that the primary forest with numerous niches presents high richness of species, but human action reduces the general richness, which reflects mainly in the small number of species.

abstract = {The Neotropical otter is a predator located in the upper trophic level; its geographical distribution stretches from northern Mexico to central Argentina. It lives in river banks, where it rests, plays, marks its territory, cleans its fur and breeds its offspring. Lontra longicaudis is sensitive to alterations in the habitat, either by the degradation of river bank environments and by pollution of water bodies; hence, it is considered as an indicator of the degradation of aquatic ecosystems. This species is currently included in the threatened species category according to NOM-059-SEMARNAT-2010. The aim of this work is to characterize the habitat and determine the abundance of the Neotropical otter in the upper part of San Diego River, to assess whether the sea otter population abundance is directly related on the characteristics of the habitat and the seasonal dynamics. The monitoring was carried out over two years (2012-2013). Eight kilometers along the river were sampled considering 3 segments of equal length, since preliminary visits revealed that these had distinctive physical and environmental characteristics. The physicochemical parameters of water were measured, plant species growing along the river bank were identified, 266 samples of feces were collected, and otter relative abundance was estimated. Segment 1 showed an acid water pH, with low temperatures and plant species of the genera Pinus, Quercus and Juniperus along the river banks; the second segment showed a neutral pH, with higher temperatures, and scarce riparian vegetation; the third segment again displayed riparian vegetation, with warm water and near-neutral pH. The relative abundance determined for the otter population averaged 0.46 otters/km. A model for predicting otter abundance was obtained, which yielded a prediction error of ± 0.27 otters/km. The characteristics of the habitat associated with otters in this area were similar to those described by other authors for other parts of the country, namely a neutral pH, clean oxygen-rich waters, low water temperature in the upper portions of the river, presence of riparian vegetation, with stretches of rapids and shallow areas with pools of slow-flowing, deep water. Separately, the abundance of otters found in this case lied within a range that differed from the one reported by other authors, which varies between 0.21 and 1.22 otters/km; again, this was not a fixed value, but varied over the sampling period: it decreased in the rainy season and rose in the dry season. The abundance-habitat relationship model showed an acceptable fit; however, the most significant variables were total dissolved solids, pH, flow zone and depth. This study made possible to determine the current status of the otter and the conditions of its habitat in this area; however, further studies are needed to gain a detailed understanding on the species to support decision-making and implement conservation actions.},

abstract = {For species with five or more sightings, quantitative techniques exist to test whether a species is extinct on the basis of distribution of sightings. However, 70{\%} of purportedly extinct mammals are known from fewer than five sightings, and such models do not include some important indicators of the likelihood of extinction such as threats, biological traits, search effort, and demography. Previously, we developed a quantitative method that we based on species' traits in which we used Cox proportional hazards regression to calculate the probability of rediscovery of species regarded as extinct. Here, we used two versions of the Cox regression model to determine the probability of extinction in purportedly extinct mammals and compared the results of these two models with those of stationary Poisson, nonparametric, and Weibull sighting-distribution models. For mammals with five or more sightings, the stationary Poisson model categorized all but two critically endangered (flagged as possibly extinct) species in our data set as extinct, and results with this model were consistent with current categories of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. The scores of probability of rediscovery for individual species in one version of our Cox regression model were correlated with scores assigned by the stationary Poisson model. Thus, we used this Cox regression model to determine the probability of extinction of mammals with sparse records. On the basis of the Cox regression model, the most likely mammals to be rediscovered were the Montane monkey-faced bat (Pteralopex pulchra), Armenian myotis (Myotis hajastanicus), Alcorn's pocket gopher (Pappogeomys alcorni), and Wimmer's shrew (Crocidura wimmeri). The Cox model categorized two species that have recently disappeared as extinct: the baiji (Lipotes vexillifer) and the Christmas Island pipistrelle (Pipistrellus murrayi). Our new method can be used to test whether species with few records or recent last-sighting dates are likely to be extinct.},

abstract = {We studied the spatial distribution of fruits and plants, mortality and growth rates of Scaphium macropodum (Sterculiaceae) in four 1-ha plots in a tropical rain forest in West Kalimantan, Indonesia. The species is a large deciduous tree and produces wind-dispersed fruits on defoliated twigs. The density of dispersed fruits on the ground decreased with increasing distance from a parent tree. The area under the parent's crown had the highest density of the fruits and the highest mortality of the seedlings immediately after germination. Consequently, the density of the established seedlings peaked 14 m from the tree which is outside its crown. Thick litter mainly from the parent tree seemed to physically prevent the seedlings' root from reaching the soil surface and caused the high mortality. Juvenile and mature trees distributed exclusively, suggesting that regeneration is the most successful outside of the crown of mature trees. Saplings under canopy shade did not grow well. Scaphium macropodum is hypothesized to require a gap for seedling growth and successful regeneration, whereas it can germinate and last under closed canopies as suppressed seedlings or saplings.},

abstract = {This study explores the potential of historical maps to detect, measure and monitor changes of trees outside forests. The main goal is to assess local-level changes of scattered trees and orchards and their land-use determinants in two areas in Southern Germany between 1901/1905 and 2009. Firstly, overall landscape changes are recorded. Secondly, the spatial-temporal trajectories of scattered trees and their land-use determinants are identified. Thirdly, changes in quantity and fragmentation patterns of traditional orchards are analyzed in their relationship to overall land-cover change. The results confirm major losses in scattered trees, mainly due to urbanization, agricultural intensification, and land abandonment. They further reveal that, while orchards have persisted in total area, they have undergone critical changes toward a simplified landscape structure and loss of the traditional land-use mosaic, which is a characterizing feature of high nature value landscapes. Multi-temporal assessment showed that most trends have been continuous and did not change directions over time, but rather accelerated during periods of rapid change (most dramatically in the 1950-1990 period). The case of orchards and scattered trees illustrates a major problem of cultural landscapes in Europe: Semi-natural landscape features of high nature value are threatened by both intensification and abandonment of land uses. This makes their conservation a potentially costly enterprise, as both opportunity costs for lost alternative land uses and for conservation management costs arise. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

The inclusion of the subspecies should be seen as a synthesis, and not as a taxonomic endorsement. As such, we include in the new checklist 1919 avian species, 910 of which are treated as polytypic in reference works (2042 subspecies), totaling 3051 taxa at the species and subspecies level. We anticipate that several of the subspecies included in our list may be subject to future taxonomic upgrades to species status, while others will probably be shown to be invalid in the light of future taxonomic studies.

abstract = {The re-establishment of large carnivores in Norway has led to increased conflicts and the adoption of regional zoning for these predators. When planning the future distribution of large carnivores, it is important to consider details of their potential habitat tolerances and strength of inter-specific differentiation. We studied differentiation in habitat and kill sites within the large-carnivore community of south-eastern Norway. We compared habitat selection of the brown bear Ursus arctos L., Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx L., wolf Canis lupus L. and wolverine Gulo gulo L., based on radio-tracking data. Differences in kill site locations were explored using locations of documented predator-killed sheep Ovis aries L. We modelled each species' selection for, and differentiation in, habitat and kill sites on a landscape scale using resource selection functions and multinomial logistic regression. Based on projected probability of occurrence maps, we estimated continuous patches of habitat within the study area. Although bears, lynx, wolves and wolverines had overlapping distributions, we found a clear differentiation for all four species in both habitat and kill sites. The presence of bears, wolves and lynx was generally associated with rugged, forested areas at lower elevations, whereas wolverines selected rugged terrain at higher elevations. Some degree of sympatry was possible in over 40{\%} of the study area, although only 1{\textperiodcentered}5{\%} could hold all four large carnivores together. Synthesis and applications. A geographically differentiated management policy has been adopted in Norway, aimed at conserving viable populations of large carnivores while minimizing the potential for conflicts. Sympatry of all four carnivores will be most successful if regional zones are established of adequate size spanning an elevational gradient. High prey densities, low carnivore densities, low dietary overlap and scavenging opportunities have most probably led to reduced competitive exclusion. Although regional sympatry enhances the conservation of an intact guild of large carnivores, it may well increase conflict levels and resistance to carnivore conservation locally.},

abstract = {Infrastructures in natural areas are expanding rapidly worldwide. Consequently, roads, power-lines, and wind-farms cause millions of fatalities across several animal groups. Assessing the population impact of these infrastructures requires sound estimates of the total number of fatalities. These estimates can be heavily biased due to differences in searcher efficiency and carcass persistence rates, which may ultimately lead to the incorrect quantification of actual mortality, or to the inadequate prioritization of locations for mitigation. We reviewed 294 studies using carcass surveys conducted worldwide and performed analyses on the effects of variables potentially influencing searcher efficiency and carcass persistence rates. Our analytical review, including the largest number of studies to date, the use of multivariate approaches, and the study weighting by sample size, contradicts some previous findings. Whereas body mass is confirmed as the most important variable accounting for both biases, equally important was the use of dogs in searches, as they increased searcher efficiency for small carcasses, and the taxon of carcasses for persistence, as mammals persisted at higher rates than birds and the latter at higher rates than amphibians. Our results provide little support for previous ideas on the influence of the use of domestic or thawed carcasses on persistence rates. Our findings contribute to synthesizing knowledge on the main factors affecting the two main mortality biases across carcass field experiments, and suggest recommendations for improving survey designs in future studies to minimize the biases identified.},

abstract = {The present study investigated polyhalogenated aromatic hydrocarbon (PHAH) concentrations in feces of known river otters (Lontra canadensis) along the coast of southern Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. Specifically, we combined microsatellite genotyping of DNA from feces for individual identification with fecal contaminant analyses to evaluate exposure of 23 wild otters to organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and polybrominated diphenylethers (PBDEs). Overall, feces collected from otters in urban/industrial Victoria Harbor had the greatest concentrations of nearly all compounds assessed. Fecal concentrations of OCPs and PBDEs were generally low throughout the region, whereas PCBs dominated in all locations. Re-sampling of known otters over space and time revealed that PCB exposure varied with movement and landscape use. Otters with the highest fecal PCB concentrations were those inhabiting the inner reaches of Victoria Harbor and adjacent Esquimalt Harbor, and those venturing into the harbor systems. Over 50{\%} of samples collected from eight known otters in Victoria Harbor had total-PCB concentrations above the maximum allowable concentration as established for Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra) feces, with a geometric mean value (10.6 mg/kg lipid wt) that exceeded the reproductive toxicity threshold (9 mg/kg lipid wt). Those results are consistent with our findings from 1998 and 2004, and indicate that the harbors of southern Vancouver Island, particularly Victoria Harbor, are a chronic source of PCB exposure for otters. The present study further demonstrates the suitability of using otter feces as a noninvasive/destructive biomonitoring tool in contaminant studies, particularly when sampling of the same individuals at the local population-level is desired. {\textcopyright} 2009 SETAC.},

Four of five males used areas that covered 4.0–7.5 km2 (5.7 ± 1.7 km2), and one of two females monitored occupied a larger area (11.9 km2) than the males, but none of the curves of cumulative area unequivocally reached the asymptote. Generally, there was considerable overlap among individual areas used. The home-range estimates were calculated using the 100{\%} minimum convex polygon, and 95{\%} adaptive kernel methods. The areas used by the giant anteaters in the Pantanal wetland were larger than home ranges of giant anteaters in the Serra da Canastra National Park, Brazil. The habitat types were generally used in the same order as they occurred in each home range. Two giant anteaters previously monitored with VHF radio-telemetry were subsequently tracked with a modified global positioning (GPS) system in different periods. The modified GPS acquired data on activity and habitat use for c. 9 days. Giant anteaters did not show a similar pattern of habitat use during the period of study using the modified GPS unit, but their activity patterns were similar. One of the ranges recorded over 9 days with this method was larger than the range obtained over 252 days by standard VHF radio-telemetry.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} Helio Secco, Pedro Ratton, Erika Castro, Priscila da Silva Lucas and Alex Bager. Records of snakes are common in fauna road-kill monitoring studies in different Brazilian regions. To determine the intentionality of snake road-killing on a Brazilian road, the following hypotheses were tested: (1) more fake snakes are intentionally killed on the road than objects not similar to snakes; (2) the time elapsed until the first intentional fake snake road-kill is less than that for dissimilar objects; (3) the proportion of intentional collisions with fake snakes does not depend on the type of vehicle; (4) objects positioned in the center of the road are more frequently road-killed than those positioned on the roadside; (5) variation in the number of intentional road-kills is linked to variation of vehicular traffic. Fake snakes and PET bottles were placed in different positions on the MG-010 road (Minas Gerais State), and monitored for 96 hours by cameras that recorded the movement of vehicles on the lane. The numbers of intentional snake road-kills and control objects presented no differences, and the time elapsed until the first intentional road-kills was also similar. Cars and trucks are the vehicle categories with highest incidence of collisions. Objects were struck more often when positioned in the center of the road. This study proves that intentional road-killing occurs and that any small object on the road is subject to being struck by a moving vehicle. This behavior by some drivers on Brazilian roads may pose a threat to the conservation of species that venture onto these roads.},

We summarise the current knowledge on distribution, ecology, behaviour, evolution and conservation status of the species, and highlight the main threats that have been affecting it as well as priority actions for securing its survival. The current geographical range of Lontra longicaudis is discussed, as well as several efforts that have been made to update knowledge of the range. Throughout its known distribution area, the Neotropical otter has high genetic diversity, and recent molecular research suggests that variations in genetic diversity are related to geography. Taxonomic issues regarding the existence of subspecies persist, mainly due to limited sampling in key portions of the species' range. Although the Neotropical otter is widely distributed in Latin America and has flexible behaviour, it is subjected to a variety of threats, which lead this otter to be officially considered Threatened in several countries within its geographical range. The species still faces an uncertain future due to the impact of human activities, thus justifying its classification as Near Threatened in the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List. The real level of human-otter conflicts and the impact of modified environments on Neotropical otter populations are still unclear, and must be a priority focus of future studies. There is an urgent need to increase our knowledge on aspects of the Neotropical otter's biology, such as reproduction, generation time, behaviour, physiology, distribution limits, sanitary aspects, evolution and taxonomy. Understanding these topics is vital to ensure the long-term survival of the species, both at the local and at the regional scale, as well as to provide the basis for environmental education actions involving local riverside human communities.},

abstract = {Aim The aims of this study are to resolve terminological confusion around different types of species–area relationships (SARs) and their delimitation from species sampling relationships (SSRs), to provide a comprehensive overview of models and analytical methods for SARs, to evaluate these theoretically and empirically, and to suggest a more consistent approach for the treatment of species–area data.Location Curonian Spit in north-west Russia and archipelagos world-wide.Methods First, I review various typologies for SARs and SSRs as well as mathematical models, fitting procedures and goodness-of-fit measures applied to SARs. This results in a list of 23 function types, which are applicable both for untransformed (S) and for log-transformed (log S) species richness. Then, example data sets for nested plots in continuous vegetation (n = 14) and islands (n = 6) are fitted to a selection of 12 function types (linear, power, logarithmic, saturation, sigmoid) both for S and for log S. The suitability of these models is assessed with Akaike's information criterion for S and log S, and with a newly proposed metric that addresses extrapolation capability.Results SARs, which provide species numbers for different areas and have no upper asymptote, must be distinguished from SSRs, which approach the species richness of one single area asymptotically. Among SARs, nested plots in continuous ecosystems, non-nested plots in continuous ecosystems, and isolates can be distinguished. For the SARs of the empirical data sets, the normal and quadratic power functions as well as two of the sigmoid functions (Lomolino, cumulative beta-P) generally performed well. The normal power function (fitted for S) was particularly suitable for predicting richness values over ten-fold increases in area. Linear, logarithmic, convex saturation and logistic functions generally were inappropriate. However, the two sigmoid models produced unstable results with arbitrary parameter estimates, and the quadratic power function resulted in decreasing richness values for large areas.Main conclusions Based on theoretical considerations and empirical results, I suggest that the power law should be used to describe and compare any type of SAR while at the same time testing whether the exponent z changes with spatial scale. In addition, one should be aware that power-law parameters are significantly influenced by methodology.},

abstract = {Until recently, the distribution of Dactylomys dactylinus was considered to be restricted to forest habitats from the western Amazon to the east of the Xingu River in Brazil. Individuals of D. dactylinus were rescued in January 1997 from the rising waters of the hydroelectric dam of Serra da Mesa, in Central Brazil. This record extends the southern limit of the distribution of D. dactylinus, and represents also the first occurrence of this species in the Cerrado biome. The specimens were collected in patches of gallery forest of the Tocantins River and its tributaries. The Tocantins is the main river of the Araguaia-Tocantins basin. Its headwaters are located in the Cerrado biome and it is a tributary of the delta of the Amazonas River. The presence of D. dactylinus, a characteristic Amazonian lowland forest species, in the core area of the Cerrado is an evidence of the role of forested environments as mesic corridors that have been contributing to the increase of mammalian diversity in this biome.},

abstract = {Zoonotic diseases, caused by pathogens transmitted to people from vertebrate reservoirs, take an enormous toll on human health worldwide. Many of these disease agents are harbored in rodent populations, and humans are victims of “accidental” transmission. Here we explore the idea that predatory vertebrates indirectly protect human health by reducing population size of rodent reservoirs of human disease. Research frontiers include the importance of rodent population density to the incidence of human disease, as opposed to behavior or age structure effects; the roles of different types of predators in determining both population dynamics and rodent density per se; and the effects of human-caused environmental change on predators and their rodent prey. A better understanding of these basic ecological issues will inform both environmental and health policy.

abstract = {Pitfall traps are commonly used to sample reptiles and amphibians, but their use often results in high levels of mortality in small mammals. I tested a method intended to allow mammals to escape pitfall traps but retain captured amphibians and reptiles. I established 2 pitfall trap transects in each of 10 forested sites. Each transect contained 7 arrays of 4 pitfall traps each, with 28 traps/transect and 56 traps/site. I attached jute twine to the undersides of coverboards in one of the 2 transects at each site and suspended it into pitfall traps to provide escape routes for mammals; the other transect included pitfall traps without twine. Sampling occurred October 1999-June 2000, with some traps being closed during winter because snow made them inaccessible. Number of mammals retained in pitfall traps without escape strings differed significantly (234/3) from those with strings. Numbers (90/76) of amphibians captured in traps without strings did not differ significantly from those with strings. Reptile captures differed significantly (63/34) between traps without strings and those with strings. My results indicated that this method reduces mammal mortality in pitfall traps while preventing amphibians from escaping. However, reptiles may be capable of using strings to escape pitfall traps.},

abstract = {Low postdispersal mortality of palm seeds in tapir dung is hypothesized to result from the mechanical barrier provided by dung against bruchid infestation and/or from the distance to adult palms at which seeds are dispersed. We tested these hypotheses by distributing endocarps of Attalea phalerata Mart. ex Spreng. in experimental dung piles in Beni, Bolivia. Predation rates were significantly lower for seeds covered by dung than for exposed or partially covered seeds, but did not differ between seeds placed below and 50 m away from palms. Thus, dung, not short-distance dispersal, protects seeds against bruchid beetles, and may ultimately promote survival of palm seeds. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {Secondary forests account for 40{\%} of all tropical forests yet little is known regarding their suitability as habitat for diurnal large mammals and game birds. This is especially so for second-growth that develops on large areas of degraded land.Weaddress this by investigating assemblages of large-bodied birds and mammals in extensive patches of secondary forest in the Jari region of the north-eastern BrazilianAmazon, comparing species richness and abundanceagainst that of adjacent undisturbed primary forests. We conducted 184km of line-transect censuses over a period of3 mo, and found that although primary and secondary forests held a similar abundance of large vertebrates, thespecies composition was very different. Secondary forests supported a high abundance of ungulate browsers (0.85 vs0.44 indiv. per 10 km) and smaller-bodied primates (15.6 vs 4.6 indiv. per 10 km) compared with primary forests.However, large prehensile-tailed primateswere absent (black spidermonkey Ateles paniscus) or at very low abundance(GuyananredhowlermonkeyAlouatta macconelli) insecondary forest.Theabundanceof large frugivorous/granivorousbirdswasalsolowinsecondary forestscomparedwith primary forests (22.6vs37.1individuals per10 km,respectively).Faunalassemblages appear to reflect food resource availability. Concurrent vegetation surveys indicated that secondaryforests had high levels of terrestrial and understorey browse. Fruit production was largely restricted to pioneer treessuch as Bellucia and Inga spp. Although these regenerating forests were an important habitat for large mammals andbirds, they were limited in terms of faunal richness, particularly dispersers of large-seeded plants.},

De uma maneira mais simples o termo biodiversidade {\'{e}} usado como sin{\^{o}}-nimo de riqueza de esp{\'{e}}cies. Este, entretanto, refere-se apenas ao n{\'{u}}mero de esp{\'{e}}cies presen-te numa determinada {\'{a}}rea definida. Algumas defini{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es quantitativas de diversidade incluem n{\~{a}}o apenas o aspecto variedade como tamb{\'{e}}m uma medida de abund{\^{a}}ncia relativa, e t{\^{e}}m sido empregadas de maneira mais restrita ao considerarem apenas um determinado n{\'{i}}vel. No n{\'{i}}vel das esp{\'{e}}cies pode-se falar, ent{\~{a}}o, da diversidade de esp{\'{e}}cies, que inclui a variedade e a abun-d{\^{a}}ncia relativa das esp{\'{e}}cies. Como exemplo da diversidade de esp{\'{e}}cies considere uma amostra de 100 indiv{\'{i}}duos re-tirados de uma comunidade, distribu{\'{i}}dos em 10 esp{\'{e}}cies com 10 indiv{\'{i}}duos cada, e outra a-mostra de uma segunda comunidade, tamb{\'{e}}m com 10 esp{\'{e}}cies, mas com uma das esp{\'{e}}cies apresentando 55 indiv{\'{i}}duos e todas as outras apenas cinco. Numa amostra ao acaso, as chan-ces de retirar dois indiv{\'{i}}duos que sejam de diferentes esp{\'{e}}cies {\'{e}} maior na primeira comunida-de do que na segunda. Assim, embora as duas comunidades apresentem a mesma riqueza de esp{\'{e}}cies (10), a primeira possui uma distribui{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o das abund{\^{a}}ncias mais uniforme, sendo, por-tanto, mais diversa do que a segunda. Uma defini{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o precisa de biodiversidade, entretanto, deve considerar tr{\^{e}}s n{\'{i}}veis: a di-versidade de esp{\'{e}}cies, a diversidade gen{\'{e}}tica e a diversidade de ecossistemas. Assim, biodi-versidade refere-se a todas as formas de vida, incluindo suas varia{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es ao n{\'{i}}vel de genes, e todos os ecossistemas num espa{\c{c}}o definido como, por exemplo, a pr{\'{o}}pria Terra.

abstract = {The diet of the neotropical otter (Carnivora, Mustelidae) was studied from September 1995 to March 1997, in Volta Velha, an Atlantic Forest reserve in the coastal plain of Santa Catarina State, southern Brazil. Fecal samples were collected monthly along the rivers Sa{\'{i}}-Mirim, Bra{\c{c}}o do Norte and Volta Velha. Additionally, from October 1996 to June 1997, a qualitative and quantitative study of fish species available in the studied rivers was performed. The analysis of 202 collected fecal samples indicated a diet based on fish (mainly Hoplias malabaricus and Geophagus brasiliensis) and crustaceans (mainly Trichodactylus fluviatilis, a river crab), characterizing the neotropical otter as piscivorous-cancrivorous in the study area. The presence of fruits, reptiles, birds and mammals in the diet is occasional and opportunistic. Probably the higher consumption of a certain fish species compared to its availability and the high percentage of occurrence of T. fluviatilis in scats of the neotropical otter reflect their higher catchability.},

abstract = {This study investigated the seed dispersal of the canopy palm Attalea oleifera in a 3500 ha fragment of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We monitored ten fruiting palms during six months, when the following mammals were recorded feeding on Attalea fruits and/or seeds: (1) Brazilian squirrels (Sciurus aestuans,78 diurnal records); (2) white-eared opossums (Didelphis albiventris,8 nocturnal records); (3) black-humped agoutis (Dasyprocta prymnolopha,3 diurnal records); (4) pacas (Agouti paca,1 nocturnal record); (5) rice rats (Oryzomys capito,11 nocturnal records); and (6) short-tailed opossums (Monodelphis americana,4 diurnal records). Fruit removal on the ground reached 71.9 ? 21.9 percent after a three-month period, and most fruits were moved less than 5 m from parental palms. Squirrels generally moved fruits and endocarps 5–10 m from parents, whereas opossums, pacas, and agoutis moved 91.7, 78, and 74.1 percent of fruits less than 5 m, respectively. Oviposition on endocarps by the bruchid Pachymeros cardo ranged between 62.1 and 84.3 percent of endocarps previously manipulated by white-eared opossums, squirrels, and rice rats, whereas 57.9 percent of old endocarps collected around reproductive palms were attacked by bruchids. Moreover, oviposition on endocarps varied from 42.3 percent in the case of single endocarps to 70.9 percent of endocarps in piles. Attalea seeds abundantly germinated beneath parental palms despite the high levels of predation, and distribution of both seedlings and adults suggested that squirrels played an important role in palm recruitment at the study site.},

A formal statistical approach to this problem is provided. The approach is applied to a number of global datasets for birds, ants, mosses, lycophytes, monilophytes (ferns and horsetails), gymnosperms and also to New World grasses and UK flowering plants. Overall, our results suggest that unless the inventory of a group is nearly complete, estimating the total number of species is associated with very large margins of error. The strong influence of unpredictable variations in the discovery process on species accumulation curves makes these data unreliable in estimating total species numbers.},

(for polius); Euryoryzomys, n.gen. (for the ‘‘nitidus group''); Hylaeamys, n.gen. (for the ‘‘megacephalus group''); Mindomys, n.gen. (for hammondi); Nephelomys, n.gen. (for the ‘‘albigularis group''); Oreoryzomys, n.gen. (for balneator); Sooretamys, n.gen. (for angouya); and Transandinomys, n.gen. (for bolivaris and talamancae). All of the new genera thus constituted are morphologically diagnosable and have distinct ecogeographic distributions. Pending revisionary work that is currently in progress by other researchers, six species belonging to the ‘‘alfaroi group'' (herein construed as including alfaroi, chapmani, melanotis, rhabdops, rostratus, and saturatior) are provisionally referred to Handleyomys. As a result of these changes, the genus Oryzomys is restricted to the ‘‘palustris group'' of authors, and the tribe Oryzomyini now comprises 28 genera},

abstract = {The feeding habits of the neotropical river otter Lontra longicaudis were studied in a headwater stream of the Atlantic Forest, south-eastern Brazil, for 17 months. The otters fed mainly on fish (93{\%} of the scats), but invertebrates were also frequent items in the diet (78.9{\%} of the scats), as observed for the same species in lentic habitats and for other species of Lontra as well. It is suggested that the high proportion of invertebrates in the diet in comparison to Lutra is related to differences in the dentition of the two genera. The observed seasonal variation in the diet of L. longicaudis was probably a result of fluctuations in the abundance of a main prey item, a megalopteran larva (Corydalus sp.). Prey selection, regarded as differences between rates of predation and relative abundance of food items, was demonstrated for the two most important groups of otter prey: fish and crustaceans. Although they are able to capture mobile prey, otters seem to prefer feeding on prey showing lower escape ability - among fish they select armoured catfish, and among crustaceans they select crabs.},

L. longicaudis used almost all types of natural cavities available along river banks, and they excavated burrows or found shelter in dense grass. Two large caves were used as shelters and also to raise young. The degree of conservation of the forest and human disturbance around the shelters did not influence use by otters. However, otters used shelters located higher on the river banks more frequently, probably because they were less vulnerable to flooding. Considering all shelters found during 1 year, shelters of L. longicaudis were distributed at random along the stream, and scent marks were not concentrated around them. Number of shelters in use per month was constant throughout the year, indicating that this can be used to monitor populations of river otters.},

abstract = {Our objectives were to develop a method that would be appropriate for long-term ecological studies, but that would permit rapid surveys to evaluate biotic complementarity and land-use planning in Amazonia. The Amazon basin covers about 7 million km2. Therefore, even a sparse coverage, with one sample site per 10.000 km2, would require about 700 sampling sites. Financial considerations limit the number of sites and investment at each site, but incomplete coverage makes evaluation of biotic complementarity difficult or impossible (Reddy {\&} D{\'{a}}valos 2003). Our next challenge is to install similar systems throughout Amazonia. The cost, based on modification of Al Gentry's original design is moderate (less than US{\$} 50.000 per site if it is not necessary to immediately identify all vascular plants in plots) and we can obtain RAP results for most taxa in the short term at much lower cost. However, biological surveys will only be relevant if the local people participate and the surveys serve as much to teach the local communities about the value of their natural resources as they serve to teach the international community about biodiversity. Therefore, we want to see each site run as a long-term ecological research project by local people and institutions. Biological surveys are an important tool in land-use planning, but only the local people can implement those plans},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Bats are ecologically important mammals in tropical ecosystems; however, their populations face numerous environmental threats related to climate change, habitat loss, fragmentation, hunting, and emerging diseases. Thus, there is a pressing need to develop and implement large-scale networks to monitor trends in bat populations over extended time periods. Using data from a range of Neotropical and Paleotropical bat assemblages, we assessed the ability for long-term monitoring programs to reliably detect temporal trends in species abundance. We explored the magnitude of within-site temporal variation in abundance and evaluated the statistical power of a suite of different sampling designs for several different bat species and ensembles. Despite pronounced temporal variation in abundance of most tropical bat species, power simulations suggest that long-term monitoring programs (≥20. years) can detect population trends of 5{\%} per year or more with adequate statistical power (≥0.9). However, shorter monitoring programs (≤10. years) have insufficient power for trend detection. Overall, our analyses demonstrate that a monitoring program extending over 20. years with four surveys conducted biennially on five plots per monitoring site would have the potential for detecting a 5{\%} annual change in abundance for a suite of bat species from different ensembles. The likelihood of reaching adequate statistical power was sensitive to initial species abundance and the magnitude of count variation, stressing that only the most abundant species in an assemblage and those with generally low variation in abundance should be considered for detailed population monitoring. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Background: Titi monkeys, Callicebus, comprise the most species-rich primate genus—34 species are currently recognised, five of them described since 2005. The lack of molecular data for titi monkeys has meant that little is known of their phylogenetic relationships and divergence times. To clarify their evolutionary history, we assembled a large molecular dataset by sequencing 20 nuclear and two mitochondrial loci for 15 species, including representatives from all recognised species groups. Phylogenetic relationships were inferred using concatenated maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses, allowing us to evaluate the current taxonomic hypothesis for the genus. Results: Our results show four distinct Callicebus clades, for the most part concordant with the currently recognised morphological species-groups—the torquatus group, the personatus group, the donacophilus group, and the moloch group. The cupreus and moloch groups are not monophyletic, and all species of the formerly recognized cupreus group are reassigned to the moloch group. Two of the major divergence events are dated to the Miocene. The torquatus group, the oldest radiation, diverged c. 11 Ma; and the Atlantic forest personatus group split from the ancestor of all donacophilus and moloch species at 9–8 Ma. There is little molecular evidence for the separation of Callicebus caligatus and C. dubius, and we suggest that C. dubius should be considered a junior synonym of a polymorphic C. caligatus. Conclusions: Considering molecular, morphological and biogeographic evidence, we propose a new genus level taxonomy for titi monkeys: Cheracebus n. gen. in the Orinoco, Negro and upper Amazon basins (torquatus group), Callicebus Thomas, 1903, in the Atlantic Forest (personatus group), and Plecturocebus n. gen. in the Amazon basin and Chaco region (donacophilus and moloch groups).

abstract = {Understanding a species' occurrence requirements is essential for its conservation, and species distribution models (SDMs) are a powerful tool for this purpose. Here we estimated a SDM based on actual distribution information, in relation to climatic, hydrological, human population, and vegetation data sets, to understand the ecological requirements and geographic distribution of the Neotropical otter Lontra longicaudis, a species whose habitat requirements and conservation needs are mostly unknown. Using MaxEnt, we defined its potential distribution and most suitable areas to indicate priority areas for research and to analyze the efficiency of Protected Areas (PAs). Our findings suggest that the range of Neotropical otters could extend beyond their present estimated distribution, adding new areas in northeastern Brazil, Andean region, west Ecuador, Venezuela, Peru, Mexico, and Argentina, with higher suitability in rain forests (especially Atlantic and Amazon Forests). We also found that PAs are the most suitable areas for otter distribution. Although better than non-protected areas, PAs are close to the median of the suitability values, indicating that they still can be improved to conserve otters. Annual temperature and human population density explained most data variance in our model. We suggest the change of the actual status of Neotropical otter to Least Concern or Near Threatened categories. We recommend verifying the possible sympatry with other otters, and demonstrate that rudimentary and/or occasional recent data of occurrence can also be used in SDMs and contribute to species conservation. {\textcopyright} Marcelo Lopes Rheingantz, Jorge Fernando Saraiva de Menezes and Benoit de Thoisy.},

abstract = {Some predator species appear to conform to the mesopredator release hypothesis (MRH), in which larger predators help limit populations of smaller predators. This hypothesis has been used to explain the possible relationship between coyotes, mesopredators, and resultant cascades involving nonpredators. However, relationships between coyotes and noncanid mesopredators are poorly understood, and predictions from the MRH have rarely been rigorously tested. We monitored sympatric raccoon and coyote populations to assess 2 predictions derived from the MRH: coyote predation is an important cause of mortality in raccoon populations or raccoons avoid areas used by coyotes. Between March 2000 and September 2001, we recorded 3553 locations for 27 radio-collared raccoons and 1393 locations for 13 coyotes captured on the Max McGraw Wildlife Foundation in Illinois, USA. No raccoon mortality from coyote predation was observed during the study, and raccoon survival was .0.7 each season. All raccoon 95{\%} home ranges exhibited overlap with 95{\%} coyote home ranges in each season. The mean proportion of raccoon locations within 95{\%} coyote home ranges did not vary by sex but did vary by season. Raccoon overlap of coyote core areas varied considerably among individuals within seasons, ranging from 0{\%} to 83{\%}. However, 45{\%} of raccoons had ,10{\%} overlap with coyote core areas, whereas only 14{\%} of raccoons exhibited .50{\%} overlap. Mean overlap with core areas did not vary by season or sex. For those raccoons with home ranges overlapping coyote core areas, mean proportion of observed raccoon locations within coyote core areas was generally greater than the mean proportion of random locations. Scent-station experiments failed to document raccoon avoidance of specific sites that had been marked with coyote urine. We did not find support for a mortality prediction or avoidance prediction to support MRH with regard to raccoons and coyotes. These results suggest that relationships among mammalian predators may not be simply dictated by body size, particularly for species outside the Canidae.},

abstract = {Given current accelerated trends of tropical land conversion, forest fragments are being incorporated into many conservation programs. For investing in fragments to be a viable conservation strategy, forest fragments must maintain their ecological integrity over the long term. Based on fieldwork in 22 forest fragments in the crater lakes region of western Uganda and in the continuous forest of Kibale National Park, we examined (1) seed predation on experimentally dispersed seeds, (2) abundance and composition of the dung beetle community that may play a major role in removing seeds from sites of high seed predation, and (3) compared the fragments' seedling community composition to adult tree community composition and the seedling community in continuous forest. First, the rate of seed removal at experimental stations was lower in forest fragments (85{\%} remaining after 1 day) than at stations in the continuous forest (79{\%} remaining) and the probability of stations being discovered by seed predators was lower in fragments (23{\%}) than in the intact forest (41{\%}). Second, there was a 62 percent decline in fragment dung beetle abundance. The magnitude of this decline varied among dung beetle guilds that process dung and seeds in different fashions. The abundance of large rollers that move large seeds away from sites of defecation did not differ, but medium and smaller rollers and burying beetles that process small and medium-sized seeds were less common in the fragments than in the intact forest. Finally, we compared the seedling community composition relative to adult tree community composition by identifying all adult trees in each fragment and by sampling the composition of the seedling community. We found some evidence to suggest that there was movement of seeds among forest fragments by large-bodied dispersers, particularly chimpanzees (Pan eoghdytes) and hornbills (Ceratogymna subcylindricus)},

abstract = {There is growing recognition of the important roles played by predators in regulating ecosystems and sustaining biodiversity. Much attention has focused on the consequences of predator-regulation of herbivore populations, and associated trophic cascades. However apex predators may also control smaller 'mesopredators' through intraguild interactions. Removal of apex predators can result in changes to intraguild interactions and outbreaks of mesopredators ('mesopredator release'), leading in turn to increased predation on smaller prey. Here we provide a review and synthesis of studies of predator interactions, mesopredator release and their impacts on biodiversity. Mesopredator suppression by apex predators is widespread geographically and taxonomically. Apex predators suppress mesopredators both by killing them, or instilling fear, which motivates changes in behaviour and habitat use that limit mesopredator distribution and abundance. Changes in the abundance of apex predators may have disproportionate (up to fourfold) effects on mesopredator abundance. Outcomes of interactions between predators may however vary with resource availability, habitat complexity and the complexity of predator communities. There is potential for the restoration of apex predators to have benefits for biodiversity conservation through moderation of the impacts of mesopredators on their prey, but this requires a whole-ecosystem view to avoid unforeseen negative effects.

abstract = {Eastern North American wolves have long been recognized as morphologically distinct from both coyotes and gray wolves. This has led to questions regarding their origins and taxonomic status. Eastern wolves are mainly viewed as: (1) a smaller subspecies of gray wolf (Canis lupus lycaon), potentially the result of historical hybridization between gray wolves (C. lupus) and red wolves (C. rufus), (2) a hybrid, the result of gray wolf (C. lupus) and coyote (C. latrans) interbreeding, or (3) a distinct species, C. lycaon, closely related to the red wolf (C. rufus). Although debate persists, recent molecular studies suggest that the eastern wolf is not a gray wolf subspecies, nor the result of gray wolf/coyote hybridization. Eastern wolves were more likely a distinct species, C. lycaon, prior to the eastward spread of coyotes in the late 1800s. However, contemporary interbreeding exits between C. lycaon to both C. lupus and C. latrans over much of its present range complicating its present taxonomic characterization. While hybridization may be reducing the tax- onomic distinctiveness of C. lycaon, it should not necessarily be viewed as negative influence. Hybridization may be enhancing the adaptive potential of eastern wolves, allowing them to more effectively exploit available resources in rapidly changing environments.},

These roads differed in traffic volume and surrounding landscape management conditions. We also investigated the influence of environmental variables (mean monthly air temperature and monthly total rainfall) on the incidence of road kills. Two people monitored the roads on foot (1 000-m line transects), 3 times a month (36 samples per road). We found 2 024 vertebrate road killed specimens representing 61 species (7 amphibians, 15 reptiles, 32 birds, and 7 mammals). The toad Rhinella fernandezae was the most frequently killed species (n = 1307, 64.57{\%}). NR168 had a higher incidence of vertebrate road kills, particularity for amphibians, whereas birds had a higher incidence of road kills on PR1. We found a positive correlation between precipitation and temperature with vertebrate road kills on PR1. We suggest that vertebrate road mortality is a very serious problem for the conservation of the biodiversity in Santa Fe Province-Argentina, therefore implementing mitigation measures will be necessary.},

abstract = {Many pathogens, such as the agents of West Nile encephalitis and plague, are maintained in nature by animal reservoirs and transmitted to humans by arthropod vectors. Efforts to reduce disease incidence usually rely on vector control or immunization of humans. Lyme disease, for which no human vaccine is currently available, is a commonly reported vector-borne disease in North America and Europe. In a recently developed, ecological approach to disease prevention, we intervened in the natural cycle of the Lyme disease agent (Borrelia burgdorferi) by immunizing wild white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus), a reservoir host species, with either a recombinant antigen of the pathogen, outer surface protein A, or a negative control antigen in a repeated field experiment with paired experimental and control grids stratified by site. Outer surface protein A vaccination significantly reduced the prevalence of B. burgdorferi in nymphal blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis) collected at the sites the following year in both experiments. The magnitude of the vaccine's effect at a given site correlated with the tick infection prevalence found on the control grid, which in turn correlated with mouse density. These data, as well as differences in the population structures of B. burgdorferi in sympatric ticks and mice, indicated that nonmouse hosts contributed more to infecting ticks than previously expected. Thus, where nonmouse hosts play a large role in infection dynamics, vaccination should be directed at additional species.},

abstract = {Species lists are sources of information for studies of both conservation and macroecology. It is, however, important to differentiate between relatively complete lists and extremely incomplete ones. The aim of this study was to evaluate how sampling effort typically used in inventories affects the number of bat species captured in areas of Atlantic Forest in southeastern Brazil. We also evaluated if the number of sampled sites, size of the sampled area, and sampling effort (net hours) affect species richness. We used previously reported data from studies in Rio de Janeiro, Sa ˜o Paulo, and Minas Gerais States, and our own data collected during 1989 and 2001. Nonlinear models fit well the data for Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais States and all states together, but not for Sa ˜o Paulo State. Genera richness showed a similar pattern to that of species richness. The model used to explain the relationship between species richness and size of the study area, number of sites, and sampling effort sampled was significant. The number of sites sampled explained a significant part of the variation observed; however, other variables contributed nothing to the model, suggesting that capturing beta diversity is the most important aspect of biodiversity surveys for bats, and that increasing net hours at a given location is much more inefficient than distributing net hours across locations. We suggest 1000 captures as the minimum necessary when sampling with mist nets to capture the majority of phyllostomid species for a given site (alpha diversity). In addition, we suggest that shifting the position of the mist nets between nights will increase the probability of capturing more species.},

We applied species distribution models to build a map of habitat suitabilities, and to identify possible anthropogenic factors that affect the presence of L. longicaudis in the Lower Delta of the Paran{\'{a}} River in the Southern Cone of South America. Presence/absence of L. longicaudis was obtained using 3 methodologies (sign surveys, camera traps, and interviews) and 15 environmental predictors. Habitat suitability was higher in areas with polders built for forestry, and lower in areas with human settlements and boat traffic. At present, geographic isolation and control of access on private land and reserves appear to be effective at protecting wildlife in the Paran{\'{a}} Delta.

abstract = {Studies of Zoochorous seed dispersal system often consider crop size, yet seldom consider the kinds and amounts of fruits surrounding parent plants (the fruit neighborhood) when attempting to explain among-plant variation in fruit removal. We studied avian frugivory at 24 Schefflera morototoni trees from February to May 1998 in central Puerto Rico. The number of fruits removed by avian seed dispersers per visit was similar among focal trees (typically 2-4). In contrast, visitation rate was highly variable (range: 0-71 visits per 4 h). We used multiple regression analyses to evaluate the relative roles of crop size (focal tree ripe fruit abundance) and fruit neighborhood variables (measured within 30 m of focal trees) in affecting visitation to focal trees by avian frugivores. Visitation rate was positively related to crop size (although this variable was only significant in one of four regression models considered) and negatively related to the presence or abundance of conspecific fruits, suggesting that trees competed intraspecifically for dispersers. Relationships between visitation and heterospecific fruits were mixed-some kinds of fruits appeared to enhance visitation to focal trees, while others seemed to reduce visitation. In most regression models, neighborhood variables had larger effects on visitation than focal tree fruit crop size. Our results highlight the important effects of local fruiting environments on the ability of individual plants to attract seed dispersers.},

abstract = {The Janzen-Connell hypothesis proposes that density dependent seed and seedling mortality, combined with increasing seed and seedling survival away from the parent tree, together promote regular spacing of species and thus alpha diversity. This hypothesis has rarely been tested in tropical Africa, and rarely in montane forests anywhere. We tested this hypothesis using a combination of field experiments and observations in the most floristically diverse dry submontane forest in Nigeria. We investigated distance effects on seedling herbivory, seedling survival and seedling height growth. We found a significant decrease in herbivory with distance from conspecific adult trees for all three species of experimentally planted seedlings (Entandrophragma angolense, Deinbollia pinnata and Sterculia setigera), and also for naturally occurring seedlings of Pouteria altissima but not of Newtonia buchananii or Isolona pleurocarpa. The relative density of large seedlings/saplings of P. altissima, N. buchananii and I. pleurocarpa increased significantly at greater distance from conspecific adult trees; however, we found no significant distance effect on survival or height growth over 3 mo for all three experimentally planted species. Taken together, our results are some of the first to show that Janzen-Connell effects occur on the African continent and in particular montane tropical forest and suggest that such effects may be pantropical.},

An understanding of roadkill causes and patterns is necessary for successful management intervention. How animals perceive, use and cross roads can vary significantly from road to road and also between different sections of the same road. This study sought to better understand the features of roadkill and successful mitigation options for a 93 km section of road in Tasmania's northwest. A program of baseline monitoring, analysis and trial sites informed the development of a risk based strategy for mitigating roadkill. The trial mitigation sites experienced a 50{\%} reduction in roadkill compared with the levels prior to implementation of the trials. A number of simple, low maintenance and cost effective mitigation measures were established and offer road managers elsewhere additional options for reducing roadkill on their roads.},

abstract = {The palm Euterpe edulis Mart. is one of the dominant tree species in the Atlantic rainforest and considered a key resource for many frugivorous birds. We compared the reproductive phenology of E. edulis in three types of Atlantic rainforest (two lowland forests, restinga and coastal-plain, and a premontane forest) on Cardoso Island (Cananeia, Sao Paulo, Brazil), aiming to answer the following questions: (i) whether the reproduction of E. edulis is annual and seasonal across the years in the three forest types studied; (ii) what are the environmental factors influencing the reproductive phenology of E. edulis; and (iii) how does the timing of fruiting and fruit production of E. edulis vary among the three forest types? We evaluated the presence of flowers and fruits (immature, unripe and ripe) from August 2001 to July 2004 in 150 individuals (50 per forest), and estimated the number of infructescences with ripe fruits and the production of fruits and seeds by collecting them on the forest floor in the three forest types. Flowering and fruiting of E. edulis were annual and significantly seasonal in the three forest types, with a high synchrony of flowering and medium to low synchrony of fruiting. Flowering peaked in November and December, and immature and unripe fruits peaked in January and March, all during the rainy season. Immature and unripe fruit phases were correlated with the daylength, precipitation and temperature, important factors for fruits development. Ripe fruits peaked in April and May, in the less rainy season, with significant differences in the mean dates among forests. The number of infructescences with ripe fruits and the biomass of fruits and seeds collected on the ground also differed significantly among the forest types, being greater in the restinga and coastal plain forests, respectively. Differences in productivity were related to palm density in each area and the soil fertility. The complementary fruiting pattern of E. edulis in the forests studied may affect the distribution and abundance of certain frugivorous bird species that feed on their fruits.},

abstract = {Most large carnivore species are in global decline. Conflicts with people, particularly over depredation on small and large livestock, is one of the major causes of this decline. Along tropical deforestation frontiers, large felids often shift from natural to livestock prey because of their increased proximity to human agriculture, thus increasing the likelihood of conflicts with humans. On the basis of data from 236 cattle ranches, we describe levels of depredation by jaguars Panthera onca and pumas Puma concolor on bovine herd stocks and examine the effects of both landscape structure and cattle management on the spatial patterns and levels of predation in a highly fragmented forest landscape of southern Brazilian Amazonia. Generalized linear models showed that landscape variables, including proportion of forest area remaining and distance to the nereast riparian forest corridor, were key positive and negative determinants of predation events, respectively. We detected clear peaks of depredation during the peak calving period at the end of the dry season. Bovine herd size and proportion of forest area had positive effects on predation rates in 60 cattle ranches investigated in more detail. On the other hand, distance from the nearest riparian forest corridor was negatively correlated with the number of cattle predated. the mean proportion of cattle lost to large felids in 24 months for the region varied according to the herd class size ({\textless}500: 0.82{\%}; 500-1500: 1.24{\%}; {\textgreater} 1500: 0.26{\%}) but was never greater than 1.24{\%}. The highest annual monetary costs were detected in large cattle ranches ({\textgreater}1500 head of cattle), reaching US{\$} 885.40. Patterns of depredation can be explained by a combination of landscape and livestock management variables such as proportion of forest area, distance to the nearest riparian corridor, annual calving peak and bovine herd size. {\textcopyright} 2006 The Zoological Society of London.},

Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {1. Ecological count data (e.g. number of individuals or species) are often log-transformed to satisfy parametric test assumptions. 2. Apart from the fact that generalized linear models are better suited in dealing with count data, a log-transformation of counts has the additional quandary in how to deal with zero observations. With just one zero observation (if this observation represents a sampling unit), the whole data set needs to be fudged by adding a value (usually 1) before transformation. 3. Simulating data from a negative binomial distribution, we compared the outcome of fitting mod-els that were transformed in various ways (log, square root) with results from fitting models using quasi-Poisson and negative binomial models to untransformed count data. 4. We found that the transformations performed poorly, except when the dispersion was small and the mean counts were large. The quasi-Poisson and negative binomial models consistently per-formed well, with little bias. 5. We recommend that count data should not be analysed by log-transforming it, but instead mod-els based on Poisson and negative binomial distributions should be used.},

abstract = {Mammals have incredible biological diversity, showing extreme flexibility in eco-morphology, physiology, life history and behaviour across their evolutionary history. Undoubtedly, mammals play an important role in ecosystems by providing essential services such as regulating insect populations, seed dispersal and pollination and act as indicators of general ecosystem health. However, the macroecological and macroevolutionary processes underpinning past and present biodiversity patterns are only beginning to be explored on a global scale. It is also particularly important, in the face of the global extinction crisis, to understand these processes in order to be able to use this knowledge to prevent future biodiversity loss and loss of ecosystem services. Unfortunately, efforts to understand mammalian biodiversity have been hampered by a lack of data. New data compilations on current species' distributions, ecologies and evolutionary histories now allow an integrated approach to understand this biodiversity. We review and synthesize these new studies, exploring the past and present ecology and evolution of mammalian biodiversity, and use these findings to speculate about the mammals of our future.},

Scarabaeidae and rodents were the most frequent animal food in both seasons, complemented by birds in the wet season and unidentified mammals in the dry season. Seeds revealed Solanum lycocarpum to be the most frequent plant food in the dry season and an Annonaceae and a Cactaceae the most frequent in the wet season. A total of 33 seed morphospecies were retrieved. Although our results reveal some shared and some divergent trends from dietary studies undertaken in savanna ('cerrado') areas, we found a very high frequency of potentially harmful tourists' garbage.

abstract = {The illegal use of natural resources, manifested in activities like illegal logging, poaching, and illegal wildlife trade, poses a global threat to biodiversity. Addressing them will require an understanding of the magnitude of and factors influencing these activities. However, assessing such behaviors is challenging because of their illegal nature, making participants less willing to admit engaging in them. We compared how indirect (randomized response technique) and direct questioning techniques performed when assessing non-sensitive (fish consumption, used as negative control) and sensitive (illegal consumption of wild animals) behaviors across an urban gradient (small towns, large towns, and the large city of Manaus) in the Brazilian Amazon. We conducted 1,366 surveys of randomly selected households to assess the magnitude of consumption of meat from wild animals (i.e., wild meat) and its socioeconomic drivers, which included years the head of household lived in urban areas, age of the head of household, household size, presence of children, and poverty. The indirect method revealed higher rates of wildlife consumption in larger towns than did the direct method. Results for small towns were similar between the two methods. The indirect method also revealed socioeconomic factors influencing wild meat consumption that were not detected with direct methods. For instance, the indirect method showed that wild meat consumption increased with age of the head of household, and decreased with poverty and years the head of household lived in urban areas. Simultaneously, when responding to direct questioning, households with characteristics associated with higher wild meat consumption, as estimated from indirect questioning, tended to underreport consumption to a larger degree than households with lower wild meat consumption. Results for fish consumption, used as negative control, were similar for both methods. Our findings suggest that people edit their answers to varying degrees when responding to direct questioning, potentially biasing conclusions, and indirect methods can improve researchers' ability to identify patterns of illegal activities when the sensitivity of such activities varies across spatial (e.g., urban gradient) or social (e.g., as a function of age) contexts. This work is broadly applicable to other geographical regions and disciplines that deal with sensitive human behaviors.},

Cerdocyon thous is a species widely distributed in Brazil, in a variety of habitats ranging from open area to forests and in the central region of Tocantins (Brazil) is relatively abundant. Nevertheless, literature related to habitat use and home range of this canid in the Cerrado biome is scarce. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the use of habitat and home range of this species in the Cerrado of the central region of Tocantins. After capturing and monitoring three animals by radiotracking, we concluded that all animals spent most of their time in cerrado latu sensu and strictu sensu. Their home range varied from 2.50 to 6.72 for the MCP (Minimum Convex Polygon) and from 5.33 to 7.23 for HM (95{\%} Harmonic Mean). The core area (area with greatest concentration of localization 75{\%} HM) was 44{\%} of the home range calculated for 95{\%} HM. Thus, the present study contributes to the ecology of this canid with valuable information in one of the most threatened biomes in the world.},

abstract = {Assessing temporal changes in species extinction risk is necessary for measuring conservation success or failure and for directing conservation resources toward species or regions that would benefit most. Yet, there is no long-term picture of genuine change that allows one to associate species extinction risk trends with drivers of change or conservation actions. Through a review of 40 years of IUCN-related literature sources on species conservation status (e.g., action plans, red-data books), we assigned retrospective red-list categories to the world's carnivores and ungulates (2 groups with relatively long generation times) to examine how their extinction risk has changed since the 1970s. We then aggregated species' categories to calculate a global trend in their extinction risk over time. A decline in the conservation status of carnivores and ungulates was underway 40 years ago and has since accelerated. One quarter of all species (n = 498) moved one or more categories closer to extinction globally, while almost half of the species moved closer to extinction in Southeast Asia. The conservation status of some species improved (toward less threatened categories), but for each species that improved in status 8 deteriorated. The status of large-bodied species, particularly those above 100 kg (including many iconic taxa), deteriorated significantly more than small-bodied species (below 10 kg). The trends we found are likely related to geopolitical events (such as the collapse of Soviet Union), international regulations (such as CITES), shifting cultural values, and natural resource exploitation (e.g., in Southeast Asia). Retrospective assessments of global species extinction risk reduce the risk of a shifting baseline syndrome, which can affect decisions on the desirable conservation status of species. Such assessments can help conservationists identify which conservation policies and strategies are or are not helping safeguard biodiversity and thus can improve future strategies. Keywords:},

abstract = {The Mediterranean Basin has an important conservation value given its high biodiversity and high number of endemic species, which have co-existed with human traditional practices for centuries. However, northern areas as the Iberian Peninsula have experienced intensification in livestock production in recent past, with consequent reduction in habitat quality. In this study we assessed the importance of fenced highway verges as habitat for small mammals in Mediterranean agrosilvopastoral landscapes. More specifically, we compared small mammal abundance between highway verges and the adjacent two main land uses (‘‘montado'' and open areas); compared the vegetative structure among these land uses; and addressed how vegetation structure influences species occupancy. Thirty-six sites were sampled in agrosilvopastoral system areas in southern Portugal (sampling effort 8,840 trap-nights). A total of 351 individuals from target species were captured: 157 wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus), 95 western Mediterranean mice (Mus spretus) and 99 greater white-toothed shrews (Crocidura russula). Capture–mark– recapture analyses were performed to estimate population size. Our data suggests that fenced highway verges promote better vegetative structure conditions which in turn favor a higher animal abundance therein. We suggest the adoption of management practices to increase the height and cover of herbaceous and shrub layers in road verges, together with creating grazing controlled areas in highway vicinity, particularly in ‘‘montado'' patches, linked by vegetated linear features. This would increase habitat and refuge for a large numbers of species, including small mammals, and thus benefiting the trophic chain and the whole agrosilvopastoral system.},

We found that otters were positively associated with small-scale pastures surrounded by nearby forests at a local scale and/or negatively associated with densely forested areas. Otters further preferred deeper rivers at both local and microhabitat scales, while the availability of latrine substrates and sandbars was both important predictors of detection probability. We also deployed 12 camera traps to detect otters, and found they were much less efficient than sign surveys at determining occupancy, though our sample size is small. We conclude by proposing a methodology for standardized monitoring protocol using occupancy surveys which could be implemented across the Neotropical otter's range.},

Here we show that declines and increases can be deduced from current species distributions alone, using spatial patterns of occupancy combined with distribution size. Declining species show sparse, fragmented distributions for their distribution size, reflecting the extinction process; expanding species show denser, more aggregated distributions, reflecting colonization. Past distribution size changes for British butterflies were deduced successfully from current distributions, and former distributions had some power to predict future change. What is more, the relationship between distribution pattern and change in British butterflies independently predicted distribution change for butterfly species in Flanders, Belgium, and distribution change in British rare plant species is similarly related to spatial distribution pattern. This link between current distribution patterns and processes of distribution change could be used to assess relative levels of threat facing different species, even for regions and taxa lacking detailed historical and ecological information.},

abstract = {1. The Mesopredator Release Hypothesis (MRH) suggests that top predator suppression of mesopredators is a key ecosystem function with cascading impacts on herbivore prey, but it remains to be shown that this top-down cascade impacts the large-scale structure of ecosystems. 2. The Exploitation Ecosystems Hypothesis (EEH) predicts that regional ecosystem structures are determined by top-down exploitation and bottom-up productivity. In contrast to MRH, EEH assumes that interference among predators has a negligible impact on the structure of ecosystems with three trophic levels. 3. We use the recolonization of a top predator in a three-level boreal ecosystem as a natural experiment to test if large-scale biomass distributions and population trends support MRH. Inspired by EEH, we also test if top-down interference and bottom-up productivity impact regional ecosystem structures. 4. We use data from the Finnish Wildlife Triangle Scheme which has monitored top predator (lynx, Lynx lynx), mesopredator (red fox, Vulpes vulpes) and prey (mountain hare, Lepus timidus) abundance for 17 years in a 200 000 km(2) study area which covers a distinct productivity gradient. 5. Fox biomass was lower than expected from productivity where lynx biomass was high, whilst hare biomass was lower than expected from productivity where fox biomass was high. Hence, where interference controlled fox abundance, lynx had an indirect positive impact on hare abundance as predicted by MRH. The rates of change indicated that lynx expansion gradually suppressed fox biomass. 6. Lynx status caused shifts between ecosystem structures. In the 'interference ecosystem', lynx and hare biomass increased with productivity whilst fox biomass did not. In the 'mesopredator release ecosystem', fox biomass increased with productivity but hare biomass did not. Thus, biomass controlled top-down did not respond to changes in productivity. This fulfils a critical prediction of EEH. 7. We conclude that the cascade involving top predators, mesopredators and their prey can determine large-scale biomass distribution patterns and regional ecosystem structures. Hence, interference within trophic levels has to be taken into account to understand how terrestrial ecosystem structures are shaped.},

abstract = {Abstract Habitat fragmentation often induces edge effects that can increase, decrease or have minimal effect upon the population density of a species, depending upon environmental conditions and the requirements of the species. Using a trapping study and generalized linear mixed models, we evaluated edge effects on small tropical mammals living near roads, including two ground?dwelling (Akodon sp. and Cerradomys subflavus) and two arboreal (Marmosops incanus and Rhipidomys sp.) species. We examined the relationship of these edge effects to environmental factors at both plot and patch scales. Generalist ground?dwelling species were attracted to edges, with higher population densities recorded in habitats close to road or matrix edges where vegetation density was lower. In contrast, populations of the generalist arboreal species avoided edge habitats, their populations were found in greater density in habitats far from roads/matrix edges. Thus, our results show that patterns of edge habitat utilization were related to the ecological requirements of each species. These findings are especially important in the tropics, where demand for economic growth in many countries has accelerated the fragmentation process and has recently culminated in increased road construction and expansion. Fragmented habitats promote an increase in edge environments, and consequently will reduce the abundance of arboreal small mammal species, such as those used as models in this study.},

abstract = {Fruit-eating animals deposit viable seeds in patterns that determine the conditions under which seeds and seedlings live or die. Many tree species are scatter-dispersed by birds, bats, or other small frugivores that regurgitate, defecate, or drop seeds singly or in pairs. These scatterdispersed plant species normally recruit as isolated individuals, and are unlikely to evolve exceptional resistance to herbivores, pathogens, or to other sources of density-dependent seed or seedling mortality. Other tree species are clump-dispersed by larger terrestrial or arboreal frugivores that defecate seeds in masses which produce bouquets of seedlings. Because their seeds invariably germinate in close proximity to other seedlings, clump-dispersed species necessarily evolve chemical or mechanical defenses against seed predators, pathogens, and herbivores that act in a densitydependent manner.Population and genetic attributes should reflect this basic dichotomy in the conditions of seedling recruitment. I predict that seedlings of scatter-dispersed species rarely survive near parents or in dense aggregations under frugivore roosts. Seed dispersal should be mandatory, often to light gaps or other special habitats. Outbred adults and juveniles are expected to exist at low densities in loose aggregations or random distributions. Seedlings of clump-dispersed trees are pre-adapted for survival in dense aggregations near parents, as well as in fecal clumps. Substantial recruitment of juveniles and young adults should occur from undispersed seeds under and near parent trees. Such species should be common, highly aggregated, and show strong genetic family structure. Because recruitment requires dispersal, scatter-dispersed plant species should be especially vulnerable to loss of dispersal agents. Because offspring consistently recruit near parents, clump-dispersed plants should be less vulnerable to temporary loss of dispersal agents.},

abstract = {During the development of a study about a community of carnivorous mammals, an otter was captured and equiped with a radio transmitter in an area of mangrove in the south coast of the State of S{\~{a}}o Paulo, southeast of Brazil. This study verified that: 1 - the animal used at least three burrows without communication between them. 2 – the most used burrow was at a distance of 2,6 km from the capture place; 3 - this individual usually moved between two islands that were separated by an estuary whose medium width was of approximately 1 km; 4 – it spent a long period on a small island of approximately 0,06 Km2 where a muddy substratum prevailed, not allowing the construction of a burrow. In spite of the little time that the otter stayed with the radio-transmitter, the data obtained are of relevant importance as they show an unknown activity pattern, besides showing in a short period some patterns of burrow use. Even though the otter removed its radio-collar, it didn't cause any damage to the individual and it allowed the registration of behaviour patterns that had not been described before. Based upon the radio-transmitter as adapted, new perspectives open up for the effective study of this species, increasing the possibilities of obtaining data about activity patterns and home range for Lontra longicaudis.},

abstract = {About 45 palm species occur in the Atlantic forest of Brazil, and most of them are affected by loss of seed dispersers resulting from forest fragmentation and hunting. Here we report the effects of habitat loss and defaunation on the seed dispersal system of an endemic palm, Astrocaryum aculeatissimum. We evaluated seed removal, insect and rodent seed predation, and scatter-hoarding in nine sites, ranging from 19 ha to 79 000 ha. We report the seedling, juvenile and adult palm densities in this range of sites. Endocarps remaining beneath the parent palm had a higher probability of being preyed upon by insects in small, mostly fragmented and more defaunated sites. The frequency of successful seed removal, scatter-hoarding and consumption by rodents increased in the larger, less defaunated sites. Successful removal and dispersal collapsed in small ({\textless} 1000 ha), highly defaunated sites and frequently resulted in low densities of both seedlings and juveniles. Our results indicate that a large fraction of Atlantic forest palms that rely on scatter-hoarding rodents may become regionally extinct due to forest fragmentation and defaunation. Current management practices including palm extraction and hunting pressure have a lasting effect on Atlantic forest palm regeneration by severely limiting successful recruitment of prereproductive individuals.},

abstract = {The phenology of calling activity and reproduction of a neotropical anuran community in French Guiana was studied during one rainy season. We investigated the correlation between calling activity, rainfall, temperature and water level in two ponds and recorded the occurrence of tadpoles of pond-breeding species. The study site contained 31 calling frog species, which were divided into groups according to reproductive mode. Increased rainfall was associated with increased reproductive activity in all groups, but temporal patterns in calling activity varied significantly between groups. Species with aquatic oviposition exhibited sporadic acoustic activity, aggregating into explosive breeding events following heavy rainfall. Species laying eggs in foam nests had the peak of calling activity at the start of the rainy season. Taxa with embryonic development on vegetation called mainly from middle to late wet season, being the only group which showed a significant correlation of calling with increasing water level. Dendrobatids with terrestrial oviposition and subsequent parental tadpole transportation were continuously active. Species with direct development or with non-feeding larvae were mainly active at the beginning of the rainy season. It is concluded that phenologies of calling activity in South American tropical anuran species are strongly influenced by abiotic factors like rainfall and availability of breeding sites. The temporal limitation of the rainy season forces species to adjust calling and reproductive activity according to their reproductive modes.},

Esse fato, entre outros, gerou um mal estar pol{\'{i}}tico no estado e precipitou a descentraliza{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de parte da pol{\'{i}}tica florestal em 1999, antes, sob a compet{\^{e}}ncia federal. Em 2000, foi criado o Sistema de Licenciamento Ambiental de Propriedades Rurais (SLAPR), que teve como novidade a utiliza{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o da tecnologia de Sensoriamento Remoto e do Sistema de Informa{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es Geogr{\'{a}}ficas no Licenciamento das Propriedades. Nesse trabalho, avaliaram-se os resultados dessa pol{\'{i}}tica, bem como o processo de seu desenvolvimento, a motiva{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o e os conflitos de sua implementa{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o num estado como o Mato Grosso, que tamb{\'{e}}m se destaca pela sua elevada produ{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o agropecu{\'{a}}ria. O per{\'{i}}odo de an{\'{a}}lise foi de 2000 a 2008. Percebe-se que, a despeito da descentraliza{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o, n{\~{a}}o houve um processo organizado de participa{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o com a comunidade local para implementa{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o e/ou modifica{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o da pol{\'{i}}tica, qualificando-se como uma descentraliza{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o centralizada no corpo burocr{\'{a}}tico do estado. Sobre os resultados da pol{\'{i}}tica refletidos nos desmatamentos no estado, percebe-se que praticamente n{\~{a}}o houve diferen{\c{c}}a na quantidade de desmatamento dentro e fora do SLAPR nesse per{\'{i}}odo, n{\~{a}}o fosse pela legalidade daqueles que ocorreram dentro do Sistema, fora das Reservas Legais. O pico dessa legalidade ocorreu em 2002, quando 71{\%} dos desmatamentos acima de 200 hectares no estado foram autorizados. Esses resultados, al{\'{e}}m das diversas entrevistas realizadas com os atores envolvidos na formula{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o do SLAPR, atestam que havia um projeto econ{\^{o}}mico por tr{\'{a}}s da implementa{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o do Sistema que, no limite, legitimaria a produ{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o do estado, com a utiliza{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de uma pol{\'{i}}tica ambiental eficaz. A tecnologia envolvida na pol{\'{i}}tica simbolizava ao mesmo tempo controle do estado e transpar{\^{e}}ncia diante do mundo globalizado, que precisava de garantias sobre a legalidade dos produtos oriundos no estado. Contudo, a partir de 2003, esse projeto econ{\^{o}}mico se interrompe, para dar lugar ao vertiginoso aumento de desmatamento que ocorreu no estado. A partir de ent{\~{a}}o, os resultados da pol{\'{i}}tica se mostram deficit{\'{a}}rios em diversos aspectos, j{\'{a}} que a legalidade dos desmatamentos autorizados pela SEMA chega a 4{\%} do total realizado no estado em 2007. Essa dificuldade de compreens{\~{a}}o desse projeto econ{\^{o}}mico pelo setor produtivo e pelo novo governo do estado, a partir de 2003, refletiu negativamente no SLAPR e exp{\^{o}}s de forma mais veemente os conflitos em torno da conserva{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o das {\'{a}}reas privadas no estado. Os principais conflitos acontecem em torno do passivo ambiental existente e da quantidade de Reserva Legal em {\'{a}}rea de floresta e, para tentar solucion{\'{a}}los, o governo do estado cria, em 2008, uma lei o Mato Grosso Legal que divide o SLAPR em duas partes, prorrogando a legaliza{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o dos passivos da Reserva Legal.

Several species of large seed predators, such as deer and peccaries, are facing dramatic population collapse in tropical forests yet we do not have information about the consequences of these extinctions for seed predation. Using remote camera traps we tested if defaunated forests have a lower seed predation rate of a keystone palm (. Euterpe edulis) than pristine areas. Contrary to our expectation, we found that seed predation rates were 2.5 higher in defaunated forests and small rodents were responsible for most of the seeds eaten. Our results found that defaunation leads to changes in the seed predator communities with potential consequences for plant-animal interactions.},

abstract = {Ecologists and conservation biologists consider many issues when designing a field study, such as the expected value of the data, the interests of the study species, the welfare of individual organisms and the cost of the project. These different issues or values often conflict; however, neither animal ethics nor environmental ethics provides practical guidance on how to assess trade-offs between them. We developed a decision framework for considering trade-offs between values in ecological research, drawing on the field of ecological ethics. We used a case study of the population genetics of three frog species, in which a researcher must choose between four methods of sampling DNA from the study animals. We measured species welfare as the reduction in population growth rate following sampling, and assessed individual welfare using two different definitions: (i) the level of suffering experienced by an animal, and (ii) the level of suffering combined with loss of future life. Tipping the tails of tadpoles ranked as the best sampling method for species welfare, while collecting whole tadpoles and buccal swabbing of adult frogs ranked best for the first and second definitions of individual welfare, respectively. Toe clipping of adult frogs ranked as the worst sampling method for species welfare and the first definition of individual welfare, and equal worst for the second definition of individual welfare. When considering species and individual welfare simultaneously, toe clipping was clearly inferior to the other sampling methods, but no single sampling method was clearly superior to the other three. Buccal swabbing, collecting tadpoles and tail tipping were all preferred options, depending on the definition of individual welfare and the level of precision with which we assessed species welfare. Synthesis and applications. The decision framework we present can be used by ecologists to assess ethical and other trade-offs when planning field studies. A formal decision analysis makes transparent how a researcher might negotiate competing ethical, financial and practical objectives. Defining the components of the decision in this way can help avoid errors associated with human judgement and linguistic uncertainty. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Authors.

abstract = {Lycalopex vetulus (Lund, 1842), commonly called the hoary fox, is Brazil's smallest canid. It has a slender body and limbs and a small skull composed of relative fragile bones. Its size and skull characteristics combined with its peculiar dentition make it more suitable for an insectivorous diet rather than one of large vertebrates. L. vetulus is endemic to Brazil and occurs primarily in the south-central cerrados at low elevations. There is some evidence to indicate its presence in Bolivia. L. vetulus is widespread and abundant in Brazil and presently there are no known threats that would result in declines in its occurrence in the core area of its distribution},

abstract = {We present an algorithm that solves a two‐dimensional case of the following problem which arises in robotics: Given a body B, and a region bounded by a collection of “walls”, either find a continuous motion connecting two given positions and orientations of B during which B avoids collision with the walls, or else establish that no such motion exists. The algorithm is polynomial in the number of walls (O(n5) if n is the number of walls), but for typical wall configurations can run more efficiently. It is somewhat related to a technique outlined by Reif. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1983 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., A Wiley Company},

abstract = {Cost surface (CS) models have emerged as a useful tool to examine the interactions between landscapes patterns and wildlife at large-scale extents. This approach is particularly relevant to guide conservation planning for species that show vulnerability to road networks in human- dominated landscapes. In this study, we measured the functional connectivity of the landscape in southern Portugal and examined how it may be related to stone marten road mortality risk. We addressed three questions: (1) How different levels of landscape connectivity influence stone marten occurrence in montado patches? (2) Is there any relation between montado patches connectivity and stone marten road mortality risk? (3) If so, which road- related features might be responsible for the species' high road mortality? We developed a series of connectivity models using CS scenarios with different resistance values given to each vegetation cover type to reflect different resistance to species movement. Our models showed that the likelihood of occurrence of stone marten decreased withdistance to source areas, meaning continuous montado. Open areas and riparian areas within open area matrices entailed increased costs. We found higher stone marten mortality on roads in well-connected areas. Road sinuosity was an important factor influencing the mortality in those areas. This result challenges the way that connectivity and its relation to mortality has been generally regarded. Clearly, landscape connectivity and road-related mortality are not independent.},

Seed-dispersion patterns vary among plant species, populations and individuals, at different distances from parents, different microsites and different times. Recent field studies have made progress in elucidating the mechanisms behind these patterns and the implications of these patterns for recruitment success. Together with the development and refinement of mathematical models, this promises a deeper, more mechanistic understanding of dispersal processes and their consequences.},

Recent papers pertaining to study techniques have largely ignored the effect of habitat-dependent bias in the performance of radiotelemetry systems. Such biases cannot be overcome by increasing radiotelemetry precision, excluding data, or increasing sample sizes, as the biases are centred around data that are missing or that contain habitat-dependent errors in location. The problem is best addressed at the data-analysis stage through the use of geographic information systems. We used Monte Carlo simulations to assess the effect of habitat-dependent bias in radiotelemetry studies on the assessment of habitat selection. We looked at the effects of habitat-patch size, level of telemetry signal inhibition, level of habitat co-occurrence, and selection pattern. We demonstrated that regarding use as the composition of habitat types within a circular area around each telemetry location can help to overcome the inaccurate assessment of habitat-selection patterns that biased data produce. The size of the circular area best able to overcome the bias is related to habitat patch size and to the level of association between two or more habitat types.

abstract = {The initial spatial pattern of seed deposition influences plant population and community structure, particularly when that pattern persists through recruitment. In a vertebrate-dispersed rain forest tree, Virola calophylla, we found that spatially aggregated seed deposition strongly influenced the spatial structure of later stages. Seed dispersion was clumped, and seed densities were highest underneath V. calophylla females and the sleeping sites of spider monkeys (Ateles paniscus), the key dispersal agent. Although these site types had the lowest per capita seed-to-seedling survival, they had the highest seedling/sapling densities. Conversely, seed and seedling/sapling densities were lowest, and seed survival was highest, at sites of diurnal seed dispersal by spider monkeys. Negative density-dependent and positive distance-dependent seed survival thinned seed clumps. Nonetheless, the clumped dispersion at sleeping and parental sites persisted to the seedling/sapling stage because differences in seed deposition were large enough to offset differences in seed survival among these site types.},

Sampling was accomplished using baited photographic camera traps triggered by infra- red sensor and/or trip cord. Camera traps were armed at each sampling locality for ten consecutive days for totalling 560 camera-nights. Seventeen species of mammals were registered, including threatened or endangered species such as the giant armadillo (Priodontes maximus), giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla), puma (Puma concolor), and ocelote (Leopardus pardalis). Puma (Puma concolor), paca (Agouti paca), agouti (Dasyprocta punctata), and tapir (Tapirus terrestris), were photographed frequently, suggesting high population densities of these species at Serra das Araras. Puma appeared to be the most generalist of the large mammals, using all three habitat types. The majority of species were photographed only in forest habitats. In cerrado (sensu stricto), only three species were recorded: puma, giant anteater, and giant armadillo. The results suggest that conservation of the cerrado and associated habitats is of fundamental importance for the preservation of several threatened and endangered species.},

abstract = {The Neotropical otter Lontra longicaudis is a widespread semiaquatic carnivore living in a wide variety of environments in both fresh-water and salt-water ecosystems. We summarise the current knowledge on distribution, ecology, behaviour, evolution and conservation status of the species, and highlight the main threats that have been affecting it as well as priority actions for securing its survival. The current geographical range of Lontra longicaudis is discussed, as well as several efforts that have been made to update knowledge of the range. Throughout its known distribution area, the Neotropical otter has high genetic diversity, and recent molecular research suggests that variations in genetic diversity are related to geography. Taxonomic issues regarding the existence of subspecies persist, mainly due to limited sampling in key portions of the species' range. Although the Neotropical otter is widely distributed in Latin America and has flexible behaviour, it is subjected to a variety of threats, which lead this otter to be officially considered Threatened in several countries within its geographical range. The species still faces an uncertain future due to the impact of human activities, thus justifying its classification as Near Threatened in the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List. The real level of human-otter conflicts and the impact of modified environments on Neotropical otter populations are still unclear, and must be a priority focus of future studies. There is an urgent need to increase our knowledge on aspects of the Neotropical otter's biology, such as reproduction, generation time, behaviour, physiology, distribution limits, sanitary aspects, evolution and taxonomy. Understanding these topics is vital to ensure the long-term survival of the species, both at the local and at the regional scale, as well as to provide the basis for environmental education actions involving local riverside human communities.},

abstract = {Habitat loss is considered to be the principal cause of the local extinction of mammals worldwide. We assessed the extinction pattern of medium- and large-sized mammals caused by the effects of habitat loss in reserves in the Quadril{\'{a}}tero Ferr{\'{i}}fero, southeastern Brazil, and discussed the effectiveness of these natural remnants for conserving mammals. A literature review and field collections were conducted from 2006 to 2011 to estimate the composition and richness of mammals in nine remnants of different sizes, including reserves and non-protected areas. A species-area relation and a nested subset analysis were performed, and a degree of sensitivity to habitat loss was obtained for each species according to its frequency of occurrence. Forty-five species of mammals were recorded. There was a strong species-area relation involving the legal size of reserves. High species richness was associated with large reserves, and the z value was within the range of very isolated continental remnants. The mammalian community exhibited a nested occurrence pattern, suggesting that most species were part of a more continuous ecosystem and that non-random extinction caused by habitat loss occurred in southeastern Brazil. The negative relation found between species frequencies and body weights suggested that selective species loss is associated with decreases in the size of the reserves. The estimated viable size required to conserve all of the sensitive species is greater than the size of the largest reserve inventoried. We recommend the aggregation of neighboring natural remnants and the creation of new reserves to reduce extinction risks. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Ecological Society of Japan.},

abstract = {An experimental approach to road mitigation that maximizes inferential power is essential to ensure that mitigation is both ecologically-effective and cost-effective. Here, we set out the need for and standards of using an experimental approach to road mitigation, in order to improve knowledge of the influence of mitigation measures on wildlife populations. We point out two key areas that need to be considered when conducting mitigation experiments. First, researchers need to get involved at the earliest stage of the road or mitigation project to ensure the necessary planning and funds are available for conducting a high quality experiment. Second, experimentation will generate new knowledge about the parameters that influence mitigation effectiveness, which ultimately allows better prediction for future road mitigation projects. We identify seven key questions about mitigation structures (i.e., wildlife crossing structures and fencing) that remain largely or entirely unanswered at the population-level: (1) Does a given crossing structure work? What type and size of crossing structures should we use? (2) How many crossing structures should we build? (3) Is it more effective to install a small number of large-sized crossing structures or a large number of small-sized crossing structures? (4) How much barrier fencing is needed for a given length of road? (5) Do we need funnel fencing to lead animals to crossing structures, and how long does such fencing have to be? (6) How should we manage/manipulate the environment in the area around the crossing structures and fencing? (7) Where should we place crossing structures and barrier fencing? We provide experimental approaches to answering each of them using example Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) study designs for two stages in the road/mitigation project where researchers may become involved: (1) at the beginning of a road/mitigation project, and (2) after the mitigation has been constructed; highlighting real case studies when available.},

Herein, we present a completely new and annotated version of our checklist. For the first time, we list all bird subspecies known from Brazil that are currently accepted by at least one key ornithological reference work. The inclusion of the subspecies should be seen as a synthesis, and not as a taxonomic endorsement. As such, we include in the new checklist 1919 avian species, 910 of which are treated as polytypic in reference works (2042 subspecies), totaling 3051 taxa at the species and subspecies level. We anticipate that several of the subspecies included in our list may be subject to future taxonomic upgrades to species status, while others will probably be shown to be invalid in the light of future taxonomic studies. The results highlight Brazil as a megadiverse country and reinforce the need for proper enforcement of political tools, laws and international commitments assumed by the country to preserve its biodiversity.},

abstract = {The Neotropical otter Lontra longicaudis is a widespread semiaquatic carnivore living in a wide variety of environments in both fresh-water and salt-water ecosystems. We summarise the current knowledge on distribution, ecology, behaviour, evolution and conservation status of the species, and highlight the main threats that have been affecting it as well as priority actions for securing its survival. The current geographical range of Lontra longicaudis is discussed, as well as several efforts that have been made to update knowledge of the range. Throughout its known distribution area, the Neotropical otter has high genetic diversity, and recent molecular research suggests that variations in genetic diversity are related to geography. Taxonomic issues regarding the existence of subspecies persist, mainly due to limited sampling in key portions of the species' range. Although the Neotropical otter is widely distributed in Latin America and has flexible behaviour, it is subjected to a variety of threats, which lead this otter to be officially considered Threatened in several countries within its geographical range. The species still faces an uncertain future due to the impact of human activities, thus justifying its classification as Near Threatened in the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List. The real level of human-otter conflicts and the impact of modified environments on Neotropical otter populations are still unclear, and must be a priority focus of future studies. There is an urgent need to increase our knowledge on aspects of the Neotropical otter's biology, such as reproduction, generation time, behaviour, physiology, distribution limits, sanitary aspects, evolution and taxonomy. Understanding these topics is vital to ensure the long-term survival of the species, both at the local and at the regional scale, as well as to provide the basis for environmental education actions involving local riverside human communities.},

abstract = {Sign surveys are commonly used to study and monitor wildlife species but may be flawed when surveys are conducted only once and cover short distances, which can lead to a lack of accountability for false absences. Multiple observers surveyed for river otter (Lontra canadensis) scat and tracks along stream and reservoir shorelines at 110 randomly selected sites in eastern Kansas from January to April 2008 and 2009 to determine if detection probability differed among substrates, sign types, observers, survey lengths, and near access points. We estimated detection probabilities (p) of river otters using occupancy models in Program PRESENCE. Mean detection probability for a 400-m survey was highest in mud substrates (p = 0.60) and lowest in snow (p = 0.18) and leaf litter substrates (p = 0.27). Scat had a higher detection probability (p = 0.53) than tracks (p = 0.18), and experienced observers had higher detection probabilities (p {\textgreater} 0.71) than novice observers (p {\textless} 0.55). Detection probabilities increased almost 3-fold as survey length increased from 200 m to 1,000 m, and otter sign was not concentrated near access points. After accounting for imperfect detection, our estimates of otter site occupancy based on a 400-m survey increased {\textgreater}3-fold, providing further evidence of the potential negative bias that can occur in estimates from sign surveys when imperfect detection is not addressed. Our study identifies areas for improvement in sign survey methodologies and results are applicable for sign surveys commonly used for many species across a range of habitats.

Camera traps can provide surprising or new information about a species and can also be used to inform conservation policy when species are threatened with extinction. Camera traps may be particularly useful to primatologists studying rare or elusive species, in instances when habituation is extremely difficult or likely to harm the focal species, and when terrain is extremely difficult for humans to navigate. Primate‐specific methodological considerations and transparency are important in study design and for comparative purposes, respectively. In sum, camera traps are important tools in both epistemological and conservation research involving primates.},

Although data on the distributions of species are increasingly well resolved, the spatial distributions of threats to species are poorly understood. We mapped the distributions of eight major threats to Australia's threatened plants, vertebrates, and invertebrates using the geographic ranges of species affected by particular threats as surrogates for their spatial occurrence. Our results indicate that simply quantifying the proportion of species affected by particular threatening processes does not adequately capture the variation in the spatial extent, prevalence, or predominance of threats to species. Conservation planning is an inherently spatial process; therefore, explicitly considering the spatial dimension of threats could significantly enhance our ability to direct efforts to areas where the greatest conservation outcomes can be delivered.},

To evaluate the carcass duration time on the lane and its relation to the roadkill time event, we conducted an experiment comparing the removal rate of small carcasses between different stretches of a highway and stretches of dirt roads. The rates found in the study were considered high, with 89 {\%} of carcasses being removed in the first 24 h and 66 {\%} within 12 h. The removals were high for both road categories but reached their peaks at different periods of the day, being higher during the day on the highway and at night on dirt roads. We believe that removal on the highway is dictated by higher vehicular traffic and mainly by the action of scavenger birds during the day, while on dirt roads, it is due to the action of different opportunistic scavengers during the night.},

abstract = {Roads can disrupt the population processes of vertebrate wildlife species through habitat fragmentation and vehicle collision. The aims of this review were to synthesise the recent literature on road impacts on wildlife, to identify gaps in our understanding of this topic and to guide future research and management in Australia. We reviewed 244 published studies from the last decade on road and vehicle impacts on wildlife conducted worldwide. A geographic bias was evident among the studies, with 51{\%} conducted in North America, 25{\%} in Europe, 17{\%} in Australia and 7{\%} across several other countries. A taxonomic bias was evident towards mammals (53{\%}), with far fewer studies on birds (10{\%}), amphibians (9{\%}) and reptiles (8{\%}), and some (20{\%}) included multiple taxonomic groups. Although this bias is partly explained by large insurance and medical costs associated with collisions involving large mammals, it is also evident in Australia and signals that large components of biodiversity are being neglected. Despite a prevalence of studies on wildlife road mortality (34{\%}), population impacts are poorly described, although negative impacts are implicated for many species. Barrier effects of roads were examined in 44 studies, with behavioural aversion leading to adverse genetic consequences identified for some species. The installation of road-crossing structures for wildlife has become commonplace worldwide, but has largely outpaced an understanding of any population benefits. Road underpasses appear to be an important generic mitigation tool because a wide range of taxa use them. This knowledge can guide management until further information becomes available. Global concern about the decline of amphibians should lead to a greater focus on road impacts on this group. Priorities for research in Australia include (1) genetic studies on a range of taxa to provide an understanding of life-history traits that predispose species to barrier effects from roads, (2) studies that examine whether crossing structures alleviate population impacts from roads and (3) studies that describe the behavioural response of frogs to crossing structures and that identify factors that may promote the use of suitable structures. A national strategy to mitigate the impacts of roads on wildlife populations is long overdue and must ensure that research on this topic is adequately funded.},

abstract = {Whilst considerable research effort in Europe has linked agricultural intensification with dramatic declines of seed-feeding birds, surprisingly little is known about the wider importance of seeds in animal food-webs. Moreover, understanding the dynamics of farmland seed food resources for species of conservation concern is of considerable research interest. We examined the distribution of berries and soil-surface seeds in the managed and unmanaged habitats of a 125. ha organic farm. We took soil suction-samples over a year, counted and identified all seeds, and compared abundances and species-richness between habitats. We constructed ecological networks from literature records and by rearing insects to investigate the importance of these seeds for insects, birds and mammals. We predicted the impacts of management on seed biomass, energy and the ecosystem service of pest control across the whole farm. We estimated seed and berry food resources of up to 33. metric tons of biomass and 560. GJ of energy on the farm. Potentially, more than 330 species use the seeds as a food resource, the overwhelming majority of which are invertebrates (82{\%}) relying predominantly on non-crop and weed species. Generally, uncultivated semi-natural habitats such as woodland and mature hedgerows were more species-rich and had higher seed biomass and energy than crop habitats throughout the year, but fallow land was disproportionately important for seeds during the summer. Models of increased management intensity revealed declines of up to 19{\%} in seed biomass and energy and cascades through the network that resulted in a substantial decrease in potentially pest-controlling parasitoids. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Estimation errors inherent in stock assessment methods may make it difficult to estimate time trends in fish abundances correctly. Our objective was to quantify the probability that trends in abundance of recruits will be successfully identified. For this analysis, we used an empirically based simulation model of English sole (Parophrys vetulus) off the west coast of North America. The unique wealth of data and past analyses of this population permitted us to include deterministic and stochastic components of growth, mortality, and reproduction in a realistic manner. Errors were also included in two simulated stock assessment methods: a trawl survey and cohort analysis. Under various conditions, we calculated the probability (analogous to statistical power) that these methods will meet three management objectives concerning time trends in recruitment. Monte Carlo simulations showed that although power depends on the objective, under most realistic conditions the probability of correctly detecting recruitment time trends may be unacceptably low. These results suggest new management guidelines for fisheries.},

abstract = {Indicator species are widely adopted in conservation programs due to their time- and cost-effectiveness, and the indicator value method is a popular approach for selecting species that are indicative of particular site classifications. The indicator value method does not explicitly incorporate detection probability into its abundance or occupancy estimates. We present an approach based on N-mixture models for estimating indicator values with improved accuracy. Simulations with two site classifications demonstrate the importance of accounting for imperfect detection and how ignoring it can alter indicator values. Our simulations also illustrate the sampling conditions under which use of N-mixture models achieves reduced bias in indicator values relative to na??ve estimates based on counts and the assumption of perfect detection. Na??ve estimates produced greater bias at nearly all probabilities of detection, and exhibited greater sensitivity to low probability of detection in preferred sites compared with N-mixture estimates. Differences between the na??ve estimate and the N-mixture estimate were most pronounced when detection probability in the preferred site type was lower than 0.4. A case study with 11 species of songbirds demonstrated modest associations between most species and their "preferred" habitats, and 3 species in which preferred habitats differed between the na??ve and N-mixture model approaches. When studying less common species and in instances where detection probability varies strongly among site classifications, we recommend using the approach based on N-mixture models to improve selection and inference regarding indicator species. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

We compared six models of cameras placed sideby-side at a small spring in Mojave National Preserve, California, for 63 days in the spring of 2006, and for 40 days in the fall of 2007. Total number of different species detected varied by camera from 2 to 14 in the first trial and from 1 to 6 in the second. Total number of wildlife photographs taken by each camera ranged from 18 to 348 in the first trial and from 0 to 95 in the second. Photographic rates of a single species, mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), differed by as much as 100{\%} between two units of the same camera model. We did find, however, that the distribution of time intervals between photographs of mule deer was similar for different cameras. These results indicate that photographic rates and number of species detected by motion-triggered cameras can vary significantly even for identical models placed side by side, and have important implications regarding the interpretation of such data across areas.},

abstract = {The tradeoffs between the regulation of soil erosion, provision of fresh water, and climate regulation associated with new Pinus radiata forests in New Zealand are explored using national models. These three ecosystem services for which there is strong demand are monetised as commodities (avoided soil erosion is NZ {\$}1 per tonne; water is NZ {\$}1 per cubic metre; and sequestered carbon is assumed to be NZ {\$}73 per tonne). This permits their summation on a spatial basis to produce a national map of the net benefit of these ecosystem services. Net benefit is spatially variable depending primarily on the relative mix of forest growth rates and demand for irrigation water. New P. radiata forests (once mature) generally reduce mass-movement erosion by an order of magnitude. This provides significant benefits for erosion control where there are high natural rates of erosion. Benefits are especially large in catchments where high sedimentation is increasing flood risk and degrading aquatic ecosystems. The generally high growth rates of P. radiata in New Zealand (8.5 tonnesCha(-1)yr(-1) on average for existing forest) add significant environmental benefits of carbon sinks to climate regulation. However, the reduction of water yield associated with new forests (between 30{\%} and 50{\%}) can neutralise these benefits in catchments where there is demand for irrigation water, such as the eastern foothills of the Southern Alps and the tussock grasslands in the South Island.},

abstract = {The mechanisms that shape animal movement decisions at the level of an individual or a group of animals can scale up to affect larger-scale ecological processes. Ecologists often use mechanistic animal movement models to understand these links, but animal movement models rarely connect empirically with an understanding of how animals actually decide to move around in their environment. To better understand this relationship, we compared the travel behaviour of two sympatric mammal species that have broadly similar diets: brown capuchin monkeys, Cebus apella nigritus, and ring-tailed coatis, Nasua nasua. According to most mechanistic animal movement models, species that exploit the same resources should show similar movement patterns. Although the fruit component of coati and capuchin diets is very similar, coatis primarily feed on invertebrates in the leaf litter or soil, while capuchins forage on invertebrate prey in the forest canopy. We found that these two species showed markedly different movement patterns: while capuchins typically travelled between fruit trees in relatively straight lines, coatis had significantly more tortuous daily travel paths and frequently visited the same fruit trees more than once per day. These circular coati travel paths would not be predicted by most foraging models. We posit that these differences in coati and capuchin movement patterns are driven by differences in arboreal and terrestrial travel costs, exploitation of fallen fruits and shifts in foraging behaviour over the course of the day. Because these seemingly small differences between the two species lead to major differences in movement behaviour, we posit that animal movement models need to better incorporate (1) travel costs, (2) both directed travel and random food search and (3) realistic diet models that include resources with different nutrient compositions. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract = {Understanding why some species are at high risk of extinction, while others remain relatively safe, is central to the development of a predictive conservation science. Recent studies have shown that a species' extinction risk may be determined by two types of factors: intrinsic biological traits and exposure to external anthropogenic threats. However, little is known about the relative and interacting effects of intrinsic and external variables on extinction risk. Using phylogenetic comparative methods, we show that extinction risk in the mammal order Carnivora is predicted more strongly by biology than exposure to high-density human populations. However, biology interacts with human population density to determine extinction risk: biological traits explain 80{\%} of variation in risk for carnivore species with high levels of exposure to human populations, compared to 45{\%} for carnivores generally. The results suggest that biology will become a more critical determinant of risk as human populations expand. We demonstrate how a model predicting extinction risk from biology can be combined with projected human population density to identify species likely to move most rapidly towards extinction by the year 2030. African viverrid species are particularly likely to become threatened, even though most are currently considered relatively safe. We suggest that a preemptive approach to species conservation is needed to identify and protect species that may not be threatened at present but may become so in the near future.},

abstract = {Movement of individual organisms is fundamental to life, quilting our planet in a rich tapestry of phenomena with diverse implications for ecosystems and humans. Movement research is both plentiful and insightful, and recent methodological advances facilitate obtaining a detailed view of individual movement. Yet, we lack a general unifying paradigm, derived from first principles, which can place movement studies within a common context and advance the development of a mature scientific discipline. This introductory article to the Movement Ecology Special Feature proposes a paradigm that integrates conceptual, theoretical, methodological, and empirical frameworks for studying movement of all organisms, from microbes to trees to elephants. We introduce a conceptual framework depicting the interplay among four basic mechanistic components of organismal movement: the internal state (why move?), motion (how to move?), and navigation (when and where to move?) capacities of the individual and the external factors affecting movement. We demonstrate how the proposed framework aids the study of various taxa and movement types; promotes the formulation of hypotheses about movement; and complements existing biomechanical, cognitive, random, and optimality paradigms of movement. The proposed framework integrates eclectic research on movement into a structured paradigm and aims at providing a basis for hypothesis generation and a vehicle facilitating the understanding of the causes, mechanisms, and spatiotemporal patterns of movement and their role in various ecological and evolutionary processes.

abstract = {Both the magnitude and the urgency of the task of assessing global biodiversity require that we make the most of what we know through the use of estimation and extrapolation. Likewise, future biodiversity inventories need to be designed around the use of effective sampling and estimation procedures, especially for 'hyperdiverse' groups of terrestrial organisms, such as arthropods, nematodes, fungi, and microorganisms. The challenge of estimating patterns of species richness from samples can be separated into (i) the problem of estimating local species richness, and (ii) the problem of estimating the distinctness, or complementarity, of species assemblages. These concepts apply on a wide range of spatial, temporal, and functional scales. Local richness can be estimated by extrapolating species accumulation curves, fitting parametric distributions of relative abundance, or using non-parametric techniques based on the distribution of individuals among species or of species among samples. We present several of these methods and examine their effectiveness for an example data set. We present a simple measure of complementarity, with some biogeographic examples, and outline the difficult problem of estimating complementarity from samples. Finally, we discuss the importance of using 'reference' sites (or sub-sites) to assess the true richness and composition of species assemblages, to measure ecologically significant ratios between unrelated taxa, to measure taxon/sub-taxon (hierarchical) ratios, and to 'calibrate' standardized sampling methods. This information can then be applied to the rapid, approximate assessment of species richness and faunal or floral composition at 'comparative' sites.},

abstract = {For species that utilize different habitats throughout their life cycle, the habitat limitation at a given stage can act as a bottleneck on population abundance, impacting density-dependent processes such as individual growth and survival. We explore the influence of habitat limitation on population dynamics by developing a multi-stage population model based on lake-dwelling rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) populations where adults occupy the lake habitat but use tributaries for spawning and juvenile rearing. The model details density-dependent ecological processes and spatial ontogeny, fishing mortality and the impact of climate on growth. We ran model simulations using a range of early life stage habitat availabilities and climatic conditions representative of the native range of rainbow trout in Canada and compared the results to empirical data. The results suggest that: 1) increases in early life stage habitat leads to increases in population abundance but, due to density-dependent processes, also results in slower growing stunted populations; 2) population bottlenecks can occur at any life stage, even at the adult stage if spawning and rearing habitats are abundant; 3) when the level of competition for early life stages is increased, inter-cohort competition can lead to population cycles. The model's conclusions are further reinforced by empirical data showing a similar trend in the relationship between fish density and maximum size and providing evidence that limited early life stage habitat leads to lower fish densities and larger fish size. We provide a model that links environmental conditions to population dynamics and is useful for fisheries management and habitat conservation decisions.},

The relationship between these two is often complex and indeterminate. Ecosystem services result from the interplay of different bio- logical and physical processes across a variety of scales. Flows of ecosystem services may be imperfectly related to stocks of natural capital. Conservation is concerned with the protection of certain stocks of natural capital, but also with maintaining the complex web of relationships that characterize biodiver- sity. Despite the obvious links between ecosystem services, natural capital, and biodiversity, these are not identical. Practitioners and policy makers should be cautious in their use of the proxy indicator of ecosystem services when devel- oping mechanisms for biodiversity conservation.

Accessibility model was correlated with estimated travel-time using Pearson's Correlation and showed significant positive relationship (r = 0.714) between accessibility model and travel time observed in the field. Thus, the accessibility methodology can be a valuable tool to analyze human impacts on wildlife through hunting and logging in protected areas.},

abstract = {Marine megafauna has always elicited contrasting feelings. In the past, large marine animals were often depicted as fantastic mythological creatures and dangerous monsters, while also arousing human curiosity. Marine megafauna has been a valuable resource to exploit, leading to the collapse of populations and local extinctions. In addition, some species have been perceived as competitors of fishers for marine resources and were often actively culled. Since the 1970s, there has been a change in the perception and use of megafauna. The growth of marine tourism, increasingly oriented towards the observation of wildlife, has driven a shift from extractive to non-extractive use, supporting the conservation of at least some species of marine megafauna. In this paper, we review and compare the changes in the perception and use of three megafaunal groups, cetaceans, elasmobranchs and groupers, with a special focus on European cultures. We highlight the main drivers and the timing of these changes, compare different taxonomic groups and species, and highlight the implications for management and conservation. One of the main drivers of the shift in perception, shared by all the three groups of megafauna, has been a general increase in curiosity towards wildlife, stimulated inter alia by documentaries (from the early 1970s onwards), and also promoted by easy access to scuba diving. At the same time, environmental campaigns have been developed to raise public awareness regarding marine wildlife, especially cetaceans, a process greatly facilitated by the rise of Internet and the World Wide Web. Currently, all the three groups (cetaceans, elasmobranchs and groupers) may represent valuable resources for ecotourism. Strikingly, the economic value of live specimens may exceed their value for human consumption. A further change in perception involving all the three groups is related to a growing understanding and appreciation of their key ecological role. The shift from extractive to non-extractive use has the potential for promoting species conservation and local economic growth. However, the change in use may not benefit the original stakeholders (e.g. fishers or whalers) and there may therefore be a case for providing compensation for disadvantaged stakeholders. Moreover, it is increasingly clear that even non-extractive use may have a negative impact on marine megafauna, therefore regulations are needed.},

abstract = {Humans are altering the composition of biological communities through a variety of activities that increase rates of species invasions and species extinctions, at all scales, from local to global. These changes in components of the Earth's biodiversity cause concern for ethical and aesthetic reasons, but they also have a strong potential to alter ecosystem properties and the goods and services they provide to humanity. Ecological experiments, observations, and theoretical developments show that ecosystem properties depend greatly on biodiversity in terms of the functional characteristics of organisms present in the ecosystem and the distribution and abundance of those organisms over space and time. Species effects act in concert with the effects of climate, resource availability, and disturbance regimes in influencing ecosystem properties. Human activities can modify all of the above factors; here we focus on modification of these biotic controls. The scientific community has come to a broad consensus on many aspects of the re- lationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, including many points relevant to management of ecosystems. Further progress will require integration of knowledge about biotic and abiotic controls on ecosystem properties, how ecological communities are struc- tured, and the forces driving species extinctions and invasions. To strengthen links to policy and management, we also need to integrate our ecological knowledge with understanding of the social and economic constraints of potential management practices. Understanding this complexity, while taking strong steps to minimize current losses of species, is necessary for responsible management of Earth's ecosystems and the diverse biota they contain.},

They represent a taxonomically diversified group of morphologically similar species, and exhibit an important chromosomal diversity, particularly involving sex-autosome translocations, one of the rarest and most deleterious chromosomal changes among mammals. The results show that the species sampled are genetically well differentiated, and that chromosomal rearrangements offer accurate diagnostic characters for discriminating most species. Furthermore, the species carrying different sex-autosome translocations appear monophyletic, suggesting that a genome modification allowing a higher rate of occurrence and/or fixation of such translocations took place, leading to the emergence of this lineage. In addition to taxonomic and biogeographical clarifications, we provide a temporal framework within which patterns of genic and chromosomal evolution are discussed.},

abstract = {Roads are major barriers to animal movement and are a principal cause of habitat fragmentation in which mammalian carnivores are particularly vulnerable. Roadway underpasses are intended to increase road permeability and restore habitat connectivity. Yet, few studies have examined the movement of individuals within a population in relation to both roads and underpasses, especially in an urban environment. Therefore, I examined home range characteristics, underpass use, and vehicle-related mortality patterns of coyotes (Canis latrans) and bobcats (Felis rufus) primarily along California Route 71 (CA 71) from November 1997 through February 2000. I captured and radio- tracked 29 coyotes and 4 bobcats, and fitted an additional 24 coyotes with dog collars. Telemetry data were augmented by remotely triggered camera surveys at the underpasses. Home range sizes for 15 coyotes (1.23-54.19 km2, 95{\%} ADK) and three bobcats (3.41 to 15.26 km2, 95{\%} ADK) were highly variable. Mean core-use area sizes (50{\%} ADK) comprised an average of 15.0{\%} and 17.1{\%} of the mean home range sizes for coyotes and bobcats, respectively. The small sample size of three bobcats excluded them from most analyses. For coyotes, core-use area sizes increased as home ranges became larger. Although home range sizes among all coyote age classes were similar, juveniles had smaller core-use areas than yearlings and adults. While coyote residents had smaller home ranges than transients, their core-use area sizes did not differ. Coyote home range and core-use area sizes were similar between sexes, home range location, and road crossing behavior. For those individuals located adjacent to CA 71, 54{\%} of the coyotes and 50{\%} of the bobcats had core-use areas that overlapped the road. Buffer zone use along the road was highly variable among individual coyotes and bobcats. In fact, when coyotes were grouped by demographics, only the male yearlings, male adults, and non- crossers had similar, but not identical, patterns of buffer zone use. Home range length/width ratios differed only for home range location, with coyotes residing east of CA 71 having home ranges considerably more linear than coyotes to the west. From the radio-collared individuals with home ranges described and located near CA 71, 62{\%} of the coyotes and 100{\%} of the bobcats, plus six dog-collared coyotes, used the underpasses. Coyotes used underpasses significantly more than bobcats. Both species used the underpasses with equal frequency between years and among seasons. Yet, coyote frequency of underpass use appeared to be suppressed by traffic volume. The probability and frequency of underpass use for coyotes was similar for sexes, ages, social status, and home range location. Also, coyote density explained 34{\%} of the variability observed in coyote frequency of underpass use. Along CA 71, no bobcats were road killed, but significantly more coyotes were killed where wildlife fencing was absent, in southbound lanes, and juveniles and yearlings were killed significantly more than adults. My results suggest that roadway underpasses can be effective tools in permitting movement of individuals within their home range if they survive to become educated in the dangers of crossing over roads. However, in the absence of properly installed wildlife fencing, underpasses do not appear to facilitate the movements of dispersing individuals, which can be detrimental to the viability of populations in fragmented landscapes. Also, the current condition of the wildlife fencing probably confounded the assessment of those factors (demographic and environmental) expected to have influenced the use of the underpasses.},

Fruit removal on the ground reached 71.9 ? 21.9 percent after a three-month period, and most fruits were moved less than 5 m from parental palms. Squirrels generally moved fruits and endocarps 5–10 m from parents, whereas opossums, pacas, and agoutis moved 91.7, 78, and 74.1 percent of fruits less than 5 m, respectively. Oviposition on endocarps by the bruchid Pachymeros cardo ranged between 62.1 and 84.3 percent of endocarps previously manipulated by white-eared opossums, squirrels, and rice rats, whereas 57.9 percent of old endocarps collected around reproductive palms were attacked by bruchids. Moreover, oviposition on endocarps varied from 42.3 percent in the case of single endocarps to 70.9 percent of endocarps in piles. Attalea seeds abundantly germinated beneath parental palms despite the high levels of predation, and distribution of both seedlings and adults suggested that squirrels played an important role in palm recruitment at the study site.},

abstract = {Xenarthra (armadillos, sloths, and anteaters) constitutes one of the four major clades of placental mammals. Despite their phylogenetic distinctiveness in mammals, a reference phylogeny is still lacking for the 31 described species. Here we used Illumina shotgun sequencing to assemble 33 new complete mitochondrial genomes, establishing Xenarthra as the first major placental clade to be fully sequenced at the species level for mitogenomes. The resulting data set allowed the reconstruction of a robust phylogenetic framework and timescale that are consistent with previous studies conducted at the genus level using nuclear genes. Incorporating the full species diversity of extant xenarthrans points to a number of inconsistencies in xenarthran systematics and species definition. We propose to split armadillos into two distinct families Dasypodidae (dasypodines) and Chlamyphoridae (euphractines, chlamyphorines, and tolypeutines) to better reflect their ancient divergence, estimated around 42 Ma. Species delimitation within long-nosed armadillos (genus Dasypus) appeared more complex than anticipated, with the discovery of a divergent lineage in French Guiana. Diversification analyses showed Xenarthra to be an ancient clade with a constant diversification rate through time with a species turnover driven by high but constant extinction. We also detected a significant negative correlation between speciation rate and past temperature fluctuations with an increase in speciation rate corresponding to the general cooling observed during the last 15 My. Biogeographic reconstructions identified the tropical rainforest biome of Amazonia and the Guiana Shield as the cradle of xenarthran evolutionary history with subsequent dispersions into more open and dry habitats.},

abstract = {The Puma lineage is a monophyletic group that includes three living species: Puma concolor, Herpailurus yagouaroundi, and Acinonyx jubatus. It has been analysed from ecological and taxonomic perspectives, but their cranial ontogeny has been poorly studied. In this study, we assessed the cranial shape and size variation through three-dimensional geometric morphometric techniques, and explored the acquisition of definitive shape and size in relation to key life-history events. Each species occupied different locations in the shape morphospace: A.jubatus and P.concolor showed shorter and wider skulls, with more expanded zygomatic arches, than H.yagouaroundi, which presented the most divergent pattern of change. Ontogeny was more similar between P.concolor and A.jubatus than between the closely related P.concolor and H. yagouaroundi. The evolution of ontogenetic change in the lineage seems to be more influenced by size. Changes detected between juvenile and adult skulls enhanced predatory skills, coincident with the change from a diet of milk to a carnivorous diet. Change patterns suggest that the skull is not morphologically conservative in the lineage, in contrast with other carnivores such as canids and hyaenids. The enlargement of the rostrum observed in some canids and the reinforcement of the bite mechanism of hyaenids were not detected in this group. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Linnean Society of London.},

abstract = {Abstract: Biodiversity loss in farmlands is widely documented, and agriculture intensification has been identified as a main driver of this decline. Numerous agri-environmental policies have been implemented to assess the negative impacts of agricultural intensification on biodiversity. However, most published studies focus on land-use scenarios, thus neglecting the economic dimension. We develop a bio-economic spatially explicit modelling across 620 small French agricultural areas, which couples a public decision maker under budgetary constraint, regional economic agents in a context of uncertainty and breeding bird dynamics. Using dynamic models, we analyse the direct impacts of several current economic scenarios of the Common Agriculture Policy on common bird communities through five ecological indicators, all related to breeding populations of birds in farmlands: the farmland bird index (FBI), a generalist bird index (GBI), the Shannon diversity index, a community specialization index (CSI) and a community trophic index (CTI). We consider these indicators to scan various functional traits of bird communities. Trends in the different indicators are significantly contrasted pending on economic policy scenarios. Scenarios promoting intensive crops lead to small but specialized communities with more granivorous species, hence a low trophic level for the community. By contrast, promoting extensive grasslands increases the population size, enhances high trophic level but decreases community specialization. Evaluation of agricultural policies should not rely on a single indicator per taxonomic group. In the context of potential reversal of current bird declines, bio-economic modelling, involving farmland incomes, is proposed as a relevant support for decision making about sustainable agri-environmental policies. Promoting extensive grasslands is essential for the sustainable management of bird communities and agriculture. We, however, reveal more complex economic effects and synergies between public incentives, which appear to give interesting leverage for enhancing the bio-economic effectiveness of agricultural policies. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Tropical species are especially vulnerable to such infrastructure because they include many ecological specialists that avoid even narrow ({\textless}30-m wide) clearings and forest edges, as well as other species that are susceptible to road kill, predation or hunting by humans near roads. In addition, roads have a major role in opening up forested tropical regions to destructive colonization and exploitation. Here, we synthesize existing research on the impacts of roads and other linear clearings on tropical rainforests, and assert that such impacts are often qualitatively and quantitatively different in tropical forests than in other ecosystems. We also highlight practical measures to reduce the negative impacts of roads and other linear infrastructure on tropical species. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {According to the Janzen-Connell model, high mortality of seeds and seedlings in proximity to conspecific adults can help maintain species diversity in tropical forests. Using a natural population of big-leaf mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla King), we tested the model's mechanism by examining seed predation and juvenile recruitment in the forest understory and in treefall gaps in the vicinity of both isolated and clumped adults. We used tethered seeds placed in three types of exclosure plots: (1) complete access to seeds, (2) semi-access (access by small-sized seed predators) and (3) no access (all mammals excluded). Exclosure treatments were applied within the understory (both near and far from adults) and in gaps at eight fruiting adults in the late dry season (2001) and scored ten months later. Significantly more seeds were removed in canopy gaps near clumped adults than at isolated adults; otherwise, none of the treatment factors significantly influenced seed predation. In contrast, understory juvenile recruitment was significantly enhanced by distance from adults and was twice as high at isolated than clumped adults, providing novel support for the Janzen-Connell mechanism. No-access exclosures protected significantly more seeds than semi- and full-access exclosures, implicating small mammals in seed losses. Across the eight trees, juvenile recruitment in the no-access exclosures decreased significantly with conspecific adult densities, implicating non-mammalian density-responsive factor(s) in mortality following germination; likely a known specialist invertebrate herbivore. When all treatments were combined, conspecific adult basal area and total DBH explained 72 and 90{\%} of variation in overall juvenile recruitment, respectively. Collectively, these results indicate that Janzen-Connell effects can operate in S. macrophylla, especially during the seed-to-seedling transition, and will likely reduce recruitment in areas of high conspecific densities. They also suggest that further research into the causes of density-dependence in tropical trees should investigate mortality agents following germination.},

Most would agree, however, that both establishing protected areas and exercising some form of restraint on extraction of forest resources are among the most effective of all viable conservation measures. Deforestation, wildfires, logging, and hunting are among the leading drivers of species losses in tropical forests, and de facto or de jure protection from these threats can be conferred by either effective enforcement of regulations or physical remoteness.Attempts to assess conservation success of protected areas at large scales have rested primarily on conventional use of remote sensing to quantify spatial or temporal differences in rates of change in land cover due to deforestation and wildfires, rather than on empirical demographic or community-level metrics (Gaston et al. 2008).},

abstract = {A popular way to suggest a regional influence on local species diversity has been to plot local versus regional diversity. The form of these curves has been interpreted as evidence for or against "community saturation" due to species interactions. This interpretation, however, is unwarranted. Using the concepts of alpha, beta and gamma diversity, I show that local-regional richness curves are determined by the way total diversity is partitioned between its alpha and beta components, which itself is a matter of scale. Changing the scale of the local community amounts to changing the scale at which the heterogeneity of the interactions between organisms and their environment manifests itself, and hence the balance between alpha and beta diversity. Community saturation may occur because of physical limitations, but there are no theoretical grounds for the belief that species interactions set an absolute upper limit to diversity at any scale. A distinction between different meanings of the concept of "saturation" is proposed to clarify this issue. I argue that the challenge now is to understand the relationship between alpha and beta diversity at multiple scales, and the processes that determine it.},

@article{Colwell2012,
abstract = {Aims In ecology and conservation biology, the number of species counted in a biodiversity study is a key metric but is usually a biased underestimate of total species richness because many rare species are not detected. Moreover, comparing species richness among sites or samples is a statistical challenge because the observed number of species is sensitive to the number of individuals counted or the area sampled. For individual-based data, we treat a single, empirical sample of species abundances from an investigator-defined species assemblage or community as a reference point for two estimation objectives under two sampling models: estimating the expected number of species (and its unconditional variance) in a random sample of (i) a smaller number of individuals (multinomial model) or a smaller area sampled (Poisson model) and (ii) a larger number of individuals or a larger area sampled. For sample-based incidence (presence{\^{a}}€“absence) data, under a Bernoulli product model, we treat a single set of species incidence frequencies as the reference point to estimate richness for smaller and larger numbers of sampling units.Methods The first objective is a problem in interpolation that we address with classical rarefaction (multinomial model) and Coleman rarefaction (Poisson model) for individual-based data and with sample-based rarefaction (Bernoulli product model) for incidence frequencies. The second is a problem in extrapolation that we address with sampling-theoretic predictors for the number of species in a larger sample (multinomial model), a larger area (Poisson model) or a larger number of sampling units (Bernoulli product model), based on an estimate of asymptotic species richness. Although published methods exist for many of these objectives, we bring them together here with some new estimators under a unified statistical and notational framework. This novel integration of mathematically distinct approaches allowed us to link interpolated (rarefaction) curves and extrapolated curves to plot a unified species accumulation curve for empirical examples. We provide new, unconditional variance estimators for classical, individual-based rarefaction and for Coleman rarefaction, long missing from the toolkit of biodiversity measurement. We illustrate these methods with datasets for tropical beetles, tropical trees and tropical ants.Important Findings Surprisingly, for all datasets we examined, the interpolation (rarefaction) curve and the extrapolation curve meet smoothly at the reference sample, yielding a single curve. Moreover, curves representing 95{\%} confidence intervals for interpolated and extrapolated richness estimates also meet smoothly, allowing rigorous statistical comparison of samples not only for rarefaction but also for extrapolated richness values. The confidence intervals widen as the extrapolation moves further beyond the reference sample, but the method gives reasonable results for extrapolations up to about double or triple the original abundance or area of the reference sample. We found that the multinomial and Poisson models produced indistinguishable results, in units of estimated species, for all estimators and datasets. For sample-based abundance data, which allows the comparison of all three models, the Bernoulli product model generally yields lower richness estimates for rarefied data than either the multinomial or the Poisson models because of the ubiquity of non-random spatial distributions in nature.},

abstract = {Feeding habits of smooth-coated otters Lutra perspicillata were studied by analysing spraints collected from around the Periyar Lake within the Periyar Tiger Reserve, Kerala, India. Remains were identified by the comparison of body parts with a reference collection of appropriate prey species. Two methods were used to estimate the proportions of different prey consumed: frequency of occurrence and score-bulk estimate. The number of prey types in a spraint varied between one and seven. More prey species were found during low water levels (March-April). Fish was the major prey, followed by frogs, crabs, birds and insects. Throughout the study, the exotic tilapia and European carp constituted the major prey in the diet. The quantity of native Deccan mahsheer and endemic Periyar barb in the diet was insignificant. A higher intake of bottom-dwelling catfish was observed during periods of low water, probably because of the increased efficiency of otters to forage at these levels. By consuming large amounts of exotic species, such as tilapia and European carp, otters might contribute to the control of the rapid expansion of these species in the Periyar Lake and adjacent water bodies in the reserve. {\textcopyright} 2005 The Zoological Society of London.},

We analyze hunting practices, game yield, hunting efficiency and their relation to forest coverage rate. The hunting methods were stand hunting (55.5{\%}) and beating (44.5{\%}). Paca (Agouti paca), tatus (Dasypus novemcinctus and D. septemcinctus), and collared peccary (Pecari tajacu) were the most frequently hunted species, supplying 68{\%} of the gross game weight. Beating was significantly more efficient than stand hunting (3 vs. 1.9 kg/hunter/h, Mann-Whitney U test, P=0.02). Hunting territories were classified in three categories according to forest coverage rate. The higher the forest coverage rate the larger was the harvested species and the more efficient the hunter (Kruskal-Wallis test P=0.01). Considering the ecological and demographic changes in this pioneer settlement, development of a viable plan for game management and forest preservation is of great importance.},

Os objetivos deste estudo foram determinar os efeitos que a defauna{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o destes mam{\'{i}}feros t{\^{e}}m sobre a comunidade vegetal, bem como sobre o sucesso reprodutivo do jeriv{\'{a}} (Arecaceae: Syagrus romanzoffiana), uma planta zooc{\'{o}}rica com semente grande e que, conseq{\"{u}}entemente, deve depender de animais de maior porte para sua dispers{\~{a}}o. Com este intuito foram estudados cinco fragmentos de Mata Atl{\^{a}}ntica de Planalto com diferentes graus de defauna{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de mam{\'{i}}feros herb{\'{i}}voros de m{\'{e}}dio e grande porte, onde experimentos de exclus{\~{a}}o destes vertebrados foram implantados. A mortalidade pr{\'{o}}ximo aos co-espec{\'{i}}ficos adultos foi muito intensa, de modo que a defauna{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o pode afetar o sucesso reprodutivo de jeriv{\'{a}} pois reduz as chances de dispers{\~{a}}o de suas sementes. Apesar destas redu{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es, a fauna remanescente foi suficiente para assegurar a dispers{\~{a}}o de sementes mesmo nas maiores dist{\^{a}}ncias amostadas (at{\'{e}} 20 m). Os n{\'{i}}veis de herbivoria foram mais intensos em baixa defauna{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o e entre 5 e 10 m dos adultos. As taxas de crescimento de plantas de jeriv{\'{a}} n{\~{a}}o foram afetadas por sua dist{\^{a}}ncia at{\'{e}} os adultos ou pelo grau de defauna{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o. Ao n{\'{i}}vel da comunidade, fragmentos mais defaunados apresentaram uma densidade de plantas cerca de 90{\%} maior, tr{\^{e}}s vezes mais recrutamento e uma propor{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o do n{\'{u}}mero de esp{\'{e}}cie/planta cerca de 53{\%} menor do que fragmentos com baixa defauna{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o. A mortalidade de plantas foi reduzida em 25{\%} com a exclus{\~{a}}o experimental de vertebrados de m{\'{e}}dio e grande porte, o que deveria ter afetar pelo menos alguns dos demais par{\^{a}}metros. Assim, a falta de efeitos da exclus{\~{a}}o nestes par{\^{a}}metros deve refletir um tempo de exclus{\~{a}}o insuficiente.

abstract = {The importance of the landscape surrounding a protected area for sustaining its values is frequently discussed in conservation literature. Studies on the interactions of urbanisation and nature conservation at the global scale suggest that protected nature attracts urbanisation, and that this in turn might negatively impact the area. However, studies specifically addressing such land use dynamics at city scale are largely missing. In this study we examine the change in proportion of built up area in two zones (500 m and 1000 m) surrounding 15 urban nature reserves in southern Sweden. By using comprehensive maps from the last 50 years, we compared the zones to the overall urbanisation in the cities to reveal discrepancies in land use surrounding the nature reserves. We found that the amount of built up area in the buffer zones surrounding nature reserves followed the same trend as the corresponding cities and this relation was stable over time, although the positive relationship was not significant. The establishment of nature reserves had no detectable effect on surrounding land use, however two distinguished groups of reserves were identified with either more or less built up area in buffers zones compared to cities. These differences were related to specific local drivers such as land ownership, land use history and nature reserve location. In contrast to earlier studies at global scale, our study did not show that nature reserves attract urbanisation. Instead, we stress that the great variety of contextual factors at the city scale makes quantitative analysis of this kind extremely difficult. However, a general neglect from planning and nature conservation agencies to recognise nature reserves' dependence on the surrounding landscape configuration could be detrimental to sustain their values in the long-term. Hence we suggest that zones surrounding nature-protected areas should be planned and managed according to local land use history and current landscape conditions to enable and enhance necessary cross-boundary interactions. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Three different habitats are monitored: a river, a coastal island and a freshwater lake. Characterization of otter's shelters in the three environments related to the organization and use of the internal space is realized. One of the shelters has its temperature monitored in order to describe the relation of the frequency of use by the animal. The analysis of the diet of the specie together with visual observation is used to infer about the social organization. A close relation between the shelters with the geology and vegetation is found. The main preys of the otters indicate that it is basically a lonely animal. Depending on the season it can shows a group of two to four individuals. The preliminary results can be used as an indication to future measures related to the preservation and conservation of otters in the state.},

abstract = {The cottontail rabbit species, Sylvilagus brasiliensis, is currently understood to be constituted by 18 subspecies ranging from east central Mexico to northern Argentina, and from sea level to at least 4800 m in altitude. This hypothesis of a single widespread polytypic species remains to be critically tested. In other species groups of Sylvilagus from other geographic areas, the use of chromosomal information has been important in delineating taxonomic boundaries. To date, however, no chromosomal data are available for Sylvilagus south of Mexico. Here we report the chromosomal complement of two individuals (a male and a female) putatively ascribed to Sylvilagus brasiliensis on the basis of morphological characters and collected from southern Pen{\'{i}}nsula del Azuero in Panama. The diploid number (2n) of these two individuals was 38 and the fundamental number (autosomal arms, aFN) was 72. Karyotypes of S. brasiliensis from southern Mexico have reported two chromosomal forms: 2n=36, FN=68 and 2n=40, FN=76. We complement the chromosomal data with a morphological examination of the Panama specimens and of holotype materials pertinent to the taxonomic identity of Mesoamerican taxa of Sylvilagus. These findings, in association with others regarding the phylogenetic relationships of Sylvilagus from the Neotropics, reinforce the idea that the current taxonomic treatment of the species merits critical scrutiny. In particular, we excise Sylvilagus gabbi from subspecific synonymy with S. brasiliensis and remove the subspecies truei from brasiliensis to gabbi. {\textcopyright} 2007 by Walter de Gruyter.},

In 60 h of focal observations we recorded 202 visits of 11 birds species, in six different families consuming R. lancifolia fruits. Seed predators, as well pulp mashers were not observed. The main potential seed dispersers were Turdus leucomelas (Muscicapidae), Elaenia sp. (Tyrannidae) and Colaptes melanochloros (Picidae). We found no hourly difference in visit frequency when all of the species were together analyzed, or when only T. leucomelas and Elaenia sp. were analyzed. The time spent foraging on plants and the mean number of fruits consumed per visit differed among the bird species. Body mass and number of fruits consumed were not correlated. There was no relationship between time spent on the plant and number of fruits consumed for any species. Most of the potential seed dispersers were generalist or insectivores, yet they had high visit and fruit consumption rates, and therefore may be important seed dispersers.},

Cone production, cone size and frugivory also differed significantly among years for the same population. Avian frugivory was only occasionally affected by density of cones per plant, abundance of perches or abundance of other fruiting species, or by habitat. Rodent predation was positively related only to the density of cones per plant and then only in two sites. 4 Levels of both avian frugivory and rodent predation significantly increased in populations with higher cone production. 5 Both groups of vertebrate frugivores responded to the spatio-temporal variation in cone abundance at a regional scale, discriminating more between juniper populations than between individual plants within a population. The outcome of interactions with frugivores at the individual plant level thus proved more dependent on the whole- population characteristics than on individual attributes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Janzen-Connell model states that plant-specific natural enemies may have a disproportionately large negative effect on progeny close to maternal trees. The majority of experimental and theoretical studies addressing the Janzen-Connell model have explored how it can explain existing patterns of species diversity in tropical mainland areas. Very few studies have investigated how the model's predictions apply to isolated oceanic islands, or to the conservation management of endangered plants. Here, we provide the first experimental investigation of the predictions of the Janzen-Connell model on an oceanic island, in a conservation context. In addition, we experimentally evaluate the use of ecological analogue animals to resurrect the functional component of extinct frugivores that could have dispersed seeds away from maternal trees. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In Mauritius, we investigated seed germination and seedling survival patterns of the critically endangered endemic plant Syzygium mamillatum (Myrtaceae) in relation to proximity to maternal trees. We found strong negative effects of proximity to maternal trees on growth and survival of seedlings. We successfully used giant Aldabran tortoises as ecological analogues for extinct Mauritian frugivores. Effects of gut-passage were negative at the seed germination stage, but seedlings from gut-passed seeds grew taller, had more leaves, and suffered less damage from natural enemies than any of the other seedlings. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We provide the first experimental evidence of a distance-dependent Janzen-Connell effect on an oceanic island. Our results potentially have serious implications for the conservation management of rare plant species on oceanic islands, which harbour a disproportionately large fraction of the world's endemic and endangered plants. Furthermore, in contrast to recent controversy about the use of non-indigenous extant megafauna for re-wilding projects in North America and elsewhere, we argue that Mauritius and other oceanic islands are ideal study systems in which to empirically explore the use of ecological analogue species in restoration ecology.},

Using phylogenetic comparative methods with a newly-updated supertree of 5020 extant mammals, we investigate the impact of species traits on extinction risk within each WWF ecoregion. Our analyses reveal strong geographical variation in the influence of traits on risk: notably, larger species are at higher risk only in tropical regions. We then relate these patterns to current and recent-historical human impacts across ecoregions using spatial modelling. The body-mass results apparently reflect historical declines of large species outside the tropics due to large-scale land conversion. Narrow-ranged and rare species tend to be at high risk in areas of high current human impacts. The interactions we describe between biological traits and anthropogenic threats increase understanding of the processes determining extinction risk.},

The risk is higher in patients with permanent risk factors, who should receive indefinite anticoagulation with acenocoumarol or warfarin, except cancer patients who should receive lower doses of low molecular weight heparin The remaining patients should receive a 3-month course of treatment, after which the need to continue this treatment should be reevaluated. The decision to continue should be individually tailored and balanced against hemorrhagic risk. Determination of D-dimer values at the end of treatment and the presence of residual vein thrombosis or right ventricular dysfunction could be useful to identify patients at low risk of recurrence, who can safely discontinue anticoagulation. The emergence of new oral anticoagulants has opened up a new scenario for secondary prevention in the next few years.Copyright {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Espana, S.L. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Animal movement can be significantly altered in human-dominated landscapes such as urban and peri-urban areas, where habitat is often fragmented and/or linear. Knowledge regarding how wildlife respond to anthropogenic change is vital for informing conservation efforts in such landscapes, including the design of nature reserves and wildlife corridors. To better understand how threatened species persist and behave within human-dominated landscapes, we examined the home range and space use of the nationally endangered southern brown bandicoot Isoodon obesulus obesulus in peri-urban Melbourne, Australia's second-largest city. Specifically, we examined whether: (1) bandicoots were confined to linear strips of remnant vegetation or also made use of the broader highly modified landscape matrix; (2) the configuration of the linear vegetated strips affected home range shape; and (3) home range area differed between bandicoots living in linear strips and those in larger remnant habitat patches. We found that: (1) 71{\%} of adult males and 33{\%} of adult females used the matrix, but non-dispersing juveniles were entirely confined to the linear strips; males also travelled greater distances into the matrix (away from the vegetated strips) than females; (2) bandicoots had longer home ranges in narrower strips and males had longer home ranges than females; and (3) home range area for both sexes was smaller in linear strips than has been recorded in other studies in larger remnant habitats. Our study highlights the importance of retaining narrow, fragmented and modified vegetation to accommodate threatened biodiversity within human-dominated landscapes, but suggests the surrounding matrix may also offer important resources for adaptable species, such as bandicoots. Supporting off-reserve conservation of biodiversity in novel ecosystems is increasingly pertinent in our rapidly urbanizing world.},

abstract = {Birds as potential seed dispersers of Ocotea pulchella Mart. (Lauraceae) in a cerrado area from southeastern Brazil). Studies on frugivory and seed dispersal are extremely important for management plans, but few studies have been developed in the Brazilian cerrado. In this paper we describe the frugivory and seed dispersal of Ocotea pulchella Mart. (Lauraceae) by birds in a cerrado area in S{\~{a}}o Paulo state (21o58 S, 47o52 W), southeastern Brazil. In 72 hours of focal observations, from August to October 1999, we recorded 411 visits of 13 different bird species consuming the fruits of O. pulchella. The main potential seed dispersers were the Pale-breasted Thrush, Turdus leucomelas (Muscicapidae), the Chalk-browed Mockingbird, Mimus saturninus (Mimidae), the Great Kiskadee, Pitangus sulphuratus (Tyrannidae) and the Elaenias, Elaenia spp. (Tyrannidae). We did not find significant difference in the frequency of visits at different hour intervals throughout the day when all of the species were pooled together and when the species were individually considered. The bird species did not differ in the time they spent foraging on the plants. The number of fruits consumed in each visit differed among species and there was positive correlation between avian body mass and mean number of consumed fruits in these visits. The time spent on plants was positively correlated to the number of consumed fruits by Elaenia spp., Brown-crested Flycatcher, Myiarchus tyrannulus (Tyrannidae) and the Rufous-bellied Thrush, Turdus rufiventris (Muscicapidae). Although specialist frugivorous birds have not been observed consuming O. pulchella, generalist species were potential seed dispersers, presenting high frequency of visits, high fruit consume and shortened visit periods.},

abstract = {Tree squirrels, by virtue of their arboreal niches, granivorous (or herbivorous) feeding habits, and long, relatively unchanged history have shared a close evolutionary relationship with many of the woody plants on which they feed. As such, many tree and flying squirrels may be keystone consumers that serve as indicators of the stability of forested ecosystems. Herein, I review the evidence for evolutionary interactions between squirrels and seed trees, and provide a brief overview of the general ways in which the two influence each other's evolutionary history. I review three systems in which detailed studies have demonstrated strong evolutionary interactions between squirrels and trees: one in which squirrels act primarily as seed predators, another as herbivores, and a third in which squirrels act as both seed predators and dispersal agents. I show the detailed methodology required to uncover such interactions and the potential implications of these studies.},

abstract = {The feeding habits of the neotropical river otter Lontra longicaudis were studied in a headwater stream of the Atlantic Forest, south-eastern Brazil, for 17 months. The otters fed mainly on fish (93{\%} of the scats), but invertebrates were also frequent items in the diet (78.9{\%} of the scats), as observed for the same species in lentic habitats and for other species of Lontra as well. It is suggested that the high proportion of invertebrates in the diet in comparison to Lutra is related to differences in the dentition of the two genera. The observed seasonal variation in the diet of L. longicaudis was probably a result of fluctuations in the abundance of a main prey item, a megalopteran larva (Corydalus sp.). Prey selection, regarded as differences between rates of predation and relative abundance of food items, was demonstrated for the two most important groups of otter prey: fish and crustaceans. Although they are able to capture mobile prey, otters seem to prefer feeding on prey showing lower escape ability - among fish they select armoured catfish, and among crustaceans they select crabs.},

abstract = {Primates are a global conservation priority, with half of known species considered threatened with extinction. Monitoring trends in primate populations is important for identifying species in particular need of conservation action, and evaluating the effectiveness of interventions. Most existing primate survey methods aim to measure abundance. However, obtaining estimates of abundance with acceptable precision to detect changes in population is often expensive and time consuming. Evidence from other taxa suggests that estimating occupancy (the proportion of the area used by the species) may be less resource-intensive, yet still provide useful information for monitoring population trends. We investigate the potential of occupancy modelling for monitoring forest primates using a case study of three species of diurnal lemurs in the eastern rainforest of Madagascar. We estimated detectability and occupancy from a survey with three visits to 30 sites. Our estimates suggest that precision in occupancy estimates would be maximized by visiting a larger number of sites (therefore with limited repeat visits) for Indri indri, whereas the optimal monitoring design for Eulemur fulvus and Propithecus diadema, which showed very low detectability in our surveys, involves more frequent visits to fewer sites. Power analyses suggested that a meaningful reduction in occupancy could be detected with reasonable effort for easily detected species, but the method may prove impractical for more cryptic species. Primates pose a number of practical challenges for occupancy modelling, including choosing appropriate survey designs to satisfy closure assumptions. We suggest that if these issues can be overcome, occupancy modelling has the potential to become a valuable addition to the monitoring toolbox for the study of forest primates. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Zoological Society of London.},

abstract = {Mammal inventories in tropical forests are often difficult to carry out, and many elusive species are missed or only reported from interviews with local people. Camera traps offer a new tool for conducting inventories of large- and medium-sized terrestrial mammals. We evaluated the efficiency of camera traps based on data from two surveys carried out at a single site during 2 consecutive years. The survey efforts were 1440 and 2340 camera days, and 75 and 86{\%} of the 28 large- and medium-sized terrestrial mammal species known to occur at the site were recorded. Capture frequencies for different species were highly correlated between the surveys, and the capture probability for animals that passed in front of the cameras decreased with decreasing size of the species. Camera spacing and total survey area had little influence on the number of species recorded, with survey effort being the main factor determining the number of recorded species. Using a model we demonstrated the exponential increase in survey effort required to record the most elusive species. We evaluated the performance of different species richness estimators on this dataset and found the Jackknife estimators generally to perform best. We give recommendations on how to increase efficiency of camera trap surveys exclusively targeted at species inventories.},

Num total de 79 h de observa{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o focal foram registradas 1085 visitas de 25 esp{\'{e}}cies de aves consumindo os frutos de Talauma ovata para as duas {\'{a}}reas de estudo. Embora a maioria das esp{\'{e}}cies potencialmente dispersoras tenha h{\'{a}}bitos alimentares generalistas, estas apresentaram elevadas taxas de visitas e permaneceram pouco tempo sobre as plantas, em geral menos de 3 minutos, o que favorece a efici{\^{e}}ncia da dispers{\~{a}}o de sementes. O consumo de frutos n{\~{a}}o diferiu entre as esp{\'{e}}cies para as duas {\'{a}}reas de estudo e o tempo de perman{\^{e}}ncia sobre as plantas n{\~{a}}o diferiu entre as diferentes esp{\'{e}}cies de aves na mata semidec{\'{i}}dua, por{\'{e}}m na mata de cerrado houve uma diferen{\c{c}}a significativa. Os encontros agressivos foram observados principalmente no final do per{\'{i}}odo de frutifica{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o, mas n{\~{a}}o foram relevantes para diminuir o n{\'{u}}mero de sementes dispersas. A presen{\c{c}}a de potenciais dispersores diferenciados entre as {\'{a}}reas de estudo, como Cyanocorax cristatellus (Corvidae), Schistochlamys ruficapillus (Emberizidae) e Mimus saturninus (Mimidae), que s{\~{a}}o esp{\'{e}}cies t{\'{i}}picas de cerrado ou restritas a ambientes mais abertos, e que possivelmente n{\~{a}}o ocorreriam na {\'{a}}rea de floresta semidec{\'{i}}dua, vem demonstrar que esp{\'{e}}cies vegetais com ampla distribui{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o podem encontrar diferentes faunas dispersoras em diferentes tipos de ambiente. Nossos resultados tamb{\'{e}}m indicam que a evolu{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de um sistema de dispers{\~{a}}o generalista como o observado para T. ovata, no qual pequenos di{\'{a}}sporos produzidos em grande abund{\^{a}}ncia e dispon{\'{i}}veis para uma ampla variedade de aves, pode ser um dos fatores que permitem {\`{a}} esp{\'{e}}cie ocupar ambientes diversificados. Al{\'{e}}m disso, o grande n{\'{u}}mero de visitas observado para as duas {\'{a}}reas estudadas sugere que os arilos oleosos de T. ovata sejam uma importante fonte alimentar para as aves.},

Here we show that complex hybridization has led to contrasting patterns of genomic composition among closely related species of the Neotropical cat genus Leopardus. We show strong evidence of ancient hybridization and introgression between the pampas cat (L. colocolo) and northeastern populations of tigrina (L. tigrinus), leading to remarkable cytonuclear discordance in the latter. In contrast, southern tigrina populations show recent and continuing hybridization with Geoffroy's cat (L. geoffroyi), leading to extreme levels of interspecific admixture at their contact zone. Finally, we demonstrate that two seemingly continuous Brazilian tigrina populations show no evidence of ongoing gene flow between them, leading us to support their formal recognition as distinct species, namely L. tigrinus in the northeast and L. guttulus in the south. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The metabolic costs of animal movement have been studied extensively under laboratory conditions, although frequently these are a poor approximation of the costs of operating in the natural, heterogeneous environment. Construction of "energy landscapes," which relate animal locality to the cost of transport, can clarify whether, to what extent, and how movement properties are attributable to environmental heterogeneity. Although behavioral responses to aspects of the energy landscape are well documented in some fields (notably, the selection of tailwinds by aerial migrants) and scales (typically large), the principles of the energy landscape extend across habitat types and spatial scales. We provide a brief synthesis of the mechanisms by which environmentally driven changes in the cost of transport can modulate the behavioral ecology of animal movement in different media,develop example cost functions for movement in heterogeneous environments, present methods for visualizing these energy landscapes, and derive specific predictions of expected outcomes from individual-to population and species-level processes. Animals modulate a suite of movement parameters (e.g., route, speed, timing of movement, and tortuosity) in relation to the energy landscape, with the nature of their response being related to the energy savings available. Overall,variation in movement costs influences the quality of habitat patches and causes nonrandom movement of individuals between them. This can provide spatial and/or temporal structure to a range of population-and species level processes, ultimately including gene flow. Advances in animalattached technology and geographic information systems are opening up new avenues for measuring and mapping energy landscapes that are likely to provide new insight into their influence in animal ecology. {\textcopyright} 2013 by The University of Chicago.},

abstract = {Many carnivores have been seriously impacted by the expansion of transportation systems and networks; however we know little about carnivore response to the extent and magnitude of road mortality, or which age classes may be disproportionately impacted. Recent research has demonstrated that wildlife-vehicle-collisions (WVC) involving carnivores are modulated by temporal and spatial factors. Thus, we investigated road mortality on a guild of small and medium-sized carnivores in southern Portugal using road-kill data obtained from a systematic 36 months monitoring period along highways (260 km) and national roads (314 km) by addressing the following questions: (a) which species and age class are most vulnerable to WVC? (b) are there temporal and/or spatial patterns in road-kill? and (c) which life-history and/or spatial factors influence the likelihood of collisions? We recorded a total of 806 carnivore casualties, which represented an average of 47 ind./100 km/year. Red fox and stone marten had the highest mortality rates. Our findings highlight three key messages: (1) the majority of road-killed individuals were adults of common species; (2) all carnivores, except genets, were more vulnerable during specific life-history phenological periods: higher casualties were observed when red fox and stone marten were provisioning young, Eurasian badger casualties occurred more frequently during dispersal, and higher Egyptian mongoose mortality occurred during the breeding period; and (3) modeling demonstrated that favorable habitat, curves in the road, and low human disturbance were major contributors to the deadliest road segments. Red fox carcasses were more likely to be found on road sections with passages distant from urban areas. Conversely, stone marten mortalities were found more often on national roads with high of cork oak woodland cover; Egyptian mongoose and genet road-kills were found more often on road segments close to curves. Based on our results, two key mitigation measures should help to reduce WVC in Portugal. The first involves the improvement of existing crossings with buried and small mesh size fence to guide the individuals towards to the passages, in road segments with high traffic volume ({\textgreater}1200 vehicles/night) and located in preferred carnivore habitats. The second mitigation involves cutting or removal of dense vegetation in verges of road segments with curves to aid motorists in seeing animals about to cross. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Movement of organisms is one of the key mechanisms shaping biodiversity, e.g. the distribution of genes, individuals and species in space and time. Recent technological and conceptual advances have improved our ability to assess the causes and consequences of individual movement, and led to the emergence of the new field of 'movement ecology'. Here, we outline how movement ecology can contribute to the broad field of biodiversity research, i.e. the study of processes and patterns of life among and across different scales, from genes to ecosystems, and we propose a conceptual framework linking these hitherto largely separated fields of research. Our framework builds on the concept of movement ecology for individuals, and demonstrates its importance for linking individual organismal movement with biodiversity. First, organismal movements can provide 'mobile links' between habitats or ecosystems, thereby connecting resources, genes, and processes among otherwise separate locations. Understanding these mobile links and their impact on biodiversity will be facilitated by movement ecology, because mobile links can be created by different modes of movement (i.e., foraging, dispersal, migration) that relate to different spatiotemporal scales and have differential effects on biodiversity. Second, organismal movements can also mediate coexistence in communities, through 'equalizing' and 'stabilizing' mechanisms. This novel integrated framework provides a conceptual starting point for a better understanding of biodiversity dynamics in light of individual movement and space-use behavior across spatiotemporal scales. By illustrating this framework with examples, we argue that the integration of movement ecology and biodiversity research will also enhance our ability to conserve diversity at the genetic, species, and ecosystem levels.},

abstract = {The diet of the Neotropical otter Lontra longicaudis (Olfers, 1818) is one of the best known aspects of its biology throughout its distribution range. However, most dietary studies have been undertaken during short time periods, making it difficult to identify temporal patterns in the feeding behavior of the species. The present study aimed to describe the diet of L. longicaudis in the lower region of the Mambucaba Catchment, state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, during a three year period, based on analyses of spraints (feces). The results show fish as the main prey item (frequency of occurrence, FO = 85.78{\%}), as already described in previous studies. Crustaceans were the second main prey (FO = 70.67{\%}), occurring in the spraints during the whole year, however presenting a higher frequency of occurrence than fish in samples collected during some months. Anurans were the third most important prey item (FO = 9.56{\%}) and mammals, birds and reptiles were preyed upon only rarely (less than 4{\%}). Fish and crustaceans were present in the diet of the species throughout the year and frogs were important mostly from June to August (dry season). This higher rate of predation on amphibians during the drier months was probably related to the decrease of the main prey. {\textcopyright} 2011 Sociedade Brasileira de Zoologia.},

abstract = {Mammalian carnivores are particularly vulnerable to extinction in fragmented landscapes 1 , and their disappearance may lead to increased numbers of smaller carnivores that are principle predators of birds and other small vertebrates. Such`mesopredatorSuch`mesopredator release' 2 has been implicated in the decline and extinction of prey species 2±6. Because experimental manipulation of carnivores is logistically, {\textregistered}nancially and ethically problematic 6,7 , however, few studies have evaluated how trophic cascades generated by the decline of dominant predators combine with other fragmentation effects to in¯uence species diversity in terrestrial systems. Although the mesopredator release hypothesis has received only limited critical evaluation 8 and remains controversial 9 , it has become the basis for conservation programmes justifying the protection of carnivores 6. Here we describe a study that exploits spatial and temporal variation in the distribution and abundance of an apex predator, the coyote, in a landscape fragmented by development. It appears that the decline and disappearance of the coyote, in conjunction with the effects of habitat fragmentation, affect the distribution and abundance of smaller carnivores and the persistence of their avian prey. In coastal southern California, intensive urbanization over the past century has destroyed most of the native sage-scrub habitat, leaving undeveloped steep-sided canyons as habitat islands in an urban sea. The mesopredator release hypothesis 2 was proposed as a possible mechanism to explain the rapid disappearance of scrub-breeding birds from this system. It predicted that the decline of the most common large predator (coyote) would result in the ecological release of native (striped skunk, raccoon, grey fox) and exotic (domestic cat, opossum) mesopredators, and that increased preda-tion by these effective predators 5,10±12 would result in higher mortality and local extinction rates of scrub-breeding birds. To test these predictions, we surveyed coyotes, mesopredators and scrub-breeding birds in 28 urban habitat fragments (see Methods). Coyote populations have declined or disappeared from some fragments; backward elimination multiple regression (BEMR) analyses (Table 1a) indicated that fragment size was a positive predictor of mean coyote abundance (averaged over quarterly sampling sessions). As predicted, the relationship between coyote and mesopredator abundance among fragments was consistently negative (Table 2). Total mesopredator abundance, summed over all mesopredator species, was higher in fragments with fewer coyotes; coyote abundance had the strongest negative relationship with grey fox, cat and opossum abundance (Table 2). BEMR analyses indicated that coyote abundance was the strongest predictor of total mesopredator, fox and opossum abundance after accounting for the potentially confounding effects of fragment area, age and isolation (Table 1b). The most important predictor of cat abundance was the inverse of fragment area, as would be expected because smaller fragments have proportionally more urban edge and therefore greater access by housecats bordering the fragment. Simply the presence or absence of coyotes in a fragment also in¯uenced mesopredator abundance. Mean total mesopredator abundance was more than twice as high in fragments that coyotes never visited during the course of the study (mean, 1.17; s.d., 0.299) than in fragments where coyotes were detected at least once (mean, 0.52; s.d., 0.436). Coyote presence had the strongest negative effect on domestic cat, opossum and raccoon abundance (Table 2). BEMR indicated that coyote presence or absence was an important pre-dictor of total mesopredator, domestic cat, opossum and raccoon abundance after accounting for fragment area, age and isolation (Table 1c); the negative effect of fragment area was retained in the {\textregistered}nal regression models for total mesopredator, grey fox and domestic cat abundance. In accordance with the mesopredator release hypothesis, the direction of the correlation between the number of native scrub-specialist bird species persisting in fragments (see Methods) and mesopredator abundance was consistently negative (Table 2). Bird species diversity decreased with total mesopredator abundance; bird diversity had the strongest inverse correlation with grey fox, domestic cat, opossum and raccoon abundance (Table 2). BEMR revealed that the positive effect of fragment area and the negative effect of fragment age were the strongest determinants of bird diversity in this system (Table 1d). However, the negative effects of total mesopredator, cat and raccoon abundance on bird diversity persisted even after accounting for age and area effects. According to the mesopredator release hypothesis, the top predator should have an indirect and positive effect on bird species diversity 13. As predicted, scrub bird diversity was higher in fragments where coyotes were either present or more abundant (Table 2). Both coyote presence or absence and coyote abundance remained signi{\textregistered}cant predictors of bird diversity even after accounting for the strong effects of fragment area and age on bird populations (Table 1d). Coyote abundance also varied across time in some fragments, permitting a more direct test of the causal mechanisms underlying the correlational patterns observed in the regression analyses; temporal variability was masked in the above analyses by using mean abundances averaged across quarterly sampling sessions in each fragment. In the 13 fragments that coyotes visited only temporarily during the study, mean abundance of total mesopre-dators in quarters without coyotes was higher than in quarters with coyotes (Wilcoxon matched pairs test: Z  3:110, P  0:002); this pattern of temporal avoidance was signi{\textregistered}cant for foxes (Z  2:667, P  0:008), cats (Z  2:353, P  0:019) and skunks (Z  2:045, letters to nature NATURE | VOL 400 | 5 AUGUST 1999 | www.nature.com 563 Fragment area Fragment age (time since isolation) Figure 1 Model of the combined effects of trophic cascades and island biogeographical processes on top predators (for example, coyote), meso-predators (domestic cat) and prey (scrub-breeding birds) in a fragmented system.

We also derived a novel measure of mammal conservation importance for each site based on a "Mammalian Conservation Priority index" (MPi) which incorporates information on species richness, population abundance, body size distribution, conservation status, and forest patch area. Mammal abundance was affected by hunting pressure, whereas mammalian biomass of which was largely driven by ungulates, was significantly influenced by both forest type and hunting pressure. The MPi index, when separated into its two main components (i.e. site forest area and species-based conservation index Ci), ordered sites along a gradient of management priorities that balances species-focused and habitat-focused conservation actions. Areas with the highest conservation priority were located in semi-deciduous forest fragments, followed by lowland forests. Many of these fragments, which are often embedded within large private landholdings including biofuel and citrus or coffee crops, cattle ranches and pulpwood plantations, could be used not only to comply with environmental legislation, but also enhance the prospects for biodiversity conservation, and reduce edge effects and hunting. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {(The diet of Tapirus terrestris Linnaeus in a fragment of Atlantic Forest in northeastern Brazil). The lowland tapir (Tapirus terrestris Linnaeus, 1758) is the largest mammalian herbivore in Brazil. In the Atlantic Forest, of northeastern Brazil, only small numbers of this species remain within fragments of forest. The decline of the population of the lowland tapir is linked to hunting and to the destruction and fragmentation of its habitat, and these environmental changes may impact the diet of this potentially at-risk mammal. This study focused on tapirs living in Mata dos Pintos, a 3000 ha forest fragment in the region of Usina Serra Grande, Alagoas, Brazil. The diet of the tapirs was determined by following their paths and collecting the plant species that they had foraged on and their feces. Teeth marks identified on stems and leaves, and seeds identified from the feces, were used to determine which species of plants the tapirs were eating. Fifty-five plant species were identified as plants that the tapirs had consumed, which included 42 species that had been browsed. The most common plant families consumed were Rubiaceae, Melastomataceae and Arecaceae, which are all specific to secondary forest types or forest edges. The seeds of 19 plant species were found in the feces of the tapirs. Of these, the seeds of 15 species were intact and the seeds of six of these were large ({\textgreater}1,5 cm). Considering tapirs have a long gastrointestinal passage time, the size of the intact seeds found in the feces suggests that tapirs may act as long-distance seed dispersers for large-seeded plant species, which may have few alternative dispersal mechanisms in highly fragmented forests.},

To resolve this confl ict, we studied the effects of traffi c volume and vehicle speed on DVCs in Utah. Our results showed no relationship between AADT or PSL and DVC occurrence. There are at least 3 explanations for our results: (1) no causal relationship exists; (2) AADT and PSL, as measured, actually explain little of the variation; and (3) data quality problems exist. We discuss the likelihood for each explanation. We argue that even though traffi c speed and volume have been used to predict DVC occurrence and may be useful explanatory variables, the metrics AADT and PSL are poor surrogate variables. Thus, uses of these variables to predict risk will likely provide unreliable results},

Species perfornmance ratios (observed crossing frequency to expected crossinig frequency) wvere evaluated forfour large carnivore and three unguilate species in 11 underpass structures in Banif National Park, Alberta, Canada. Observed crossing frequencies were collected in 35 months of underpass monitoring. Expected frequencies were developedfrom three independent models: radio telemetry, pellet counts, and hab- itat-suitability indices. The null model showved that species responded to underpasses differently. In the pres- ence of human activity carnivores were less likely to utse tinderpasses than were ungulates. Apart from hbt- man act-ivity, carnivore performance ratios were better correlated to landscape variables, and ungulate performance ratios were better correlated to structural variables. We suggest that future underpasses de- signed around topography, habitat quality, and location will be minimally successful if human activity is not managed. Factores},

abstract = {We assessed the potential effect of frugivore extinctions on forest regeneration in the North Negros Forest Reserve, a forest fragment that is one of the last remaining wet tropical rainforest ecosystems in the biogeographic region of the central Philippine Islands. We evaluated foraging observations of 19 species of birds, fruit bats, and other mammals in three successional habitats and identified tree species that are poten-tially at risk because their seeds are dispersed by frugivores that are seriously endangered. The relative abun-dance of zoochorous trees in this forest community was exceptionally high (80{\%}), suggesting that the process of forest regeneration will change drastically if endangered frugivores are hunted to extinction. We grouped 45 tree species as early-, mid-, or late-successional species based on their population structure and we demon-strated that early-successional tree species were visited by a wide spectrum of frugivores, whereas mid-and late-successional species were visited mostly by hornbills (Bucerotidae) and fruit pigeons (Columbidae). Late-successional tree species were most specialized with respect to dispersers and could therefore be susceptible to extinction. We recommend tree species that could be useful for assisted natural regeneration projects in the reserve because they are visited by a variety of frugivores. Of those, we recommend early-successional trees for open-field plantations and mid-successional tree species for enrichment plantings.

The challenge is to turn this recognition into incentives and institutions that will guide wise investments in natural capital, on a large scale. Advances are required on three key fronts, each featured here: the science of ecosystem production functions and service mapping; the design of appropriate finance, policy, and governance systems; and the art of implementing these in diverse biophysical and social contexts. Scientific understanding of ecosystem production functions is improving rapidly but remains a limiting factor in incorporating natural capital into decisions, via systems of national accounting and other mechanisms. Novel institutional structures are being established for a broad array of services and places, creating a need and opportunity for systematic assessment of their scope and limitations. Finally, it is clear that formal sharing of experience, and defining of priorities for future work, could greatly accelerate the rate of innovation and uptake of new approaches.},

abstract = {Abstract: Amazonia is the largest and most diverse of the tropical forest wilderness areas. Recent compilations indicate at least 40,000 plant species, 427 mammals, 1294 birds, 378 reptiles, 427 amphibians, and around 3,000 fishes. Not homogeneous in its plant and animal communities, it is an archipelago of distinct areas of endemism separated by the major rivers. Biogeographic studies of terrestrial vertebrates have identified eight such areas in the Brazilian Amazon: Tapaj{\'{o}}s, Xing{\'{u}}, and Bel{\'{e}}m (all in Brazil); Rond{\^{o}}nia (mostly in Brazil); and portions of Napo, Imeri, Guiana, and Inambari. They range in size from more than 1.7 million km2 (Guiana) to 199,211 km2 (Bel{\'{e}}m). Forest loss in each ranges from 2{\%} to 13{\%} of their area, except for Xingu (nearly 27{\%} lost) and Bel{\'{e}}m, (now only about one-third of its forest remains). Napo, Imeri, and Guiana have {\textgreater}40{\%} of their lands in protected areas, Inambari, Rond{\^{o}}nia, Tapaj{\'{o}}s, and Xingu between 20{\%} and 40{\%}, and Bel{\'{e}}m {\textless}20{\%}. Strictly protected areas in each, however, are limited—from 0.28{\%} to 11.7{\%}. Areas of endemism should be the basic geographic unit for the creation of conservation corridors of contiguous protected areas, providing broad connectivity on both margins and within the interior of areas of endemism. The aim is to build a conservation system that is large and resilient enough to circumvent global changes, accommodate improved living standards for local populations, conserve biodiversity, and safeguard the ecological services forests and rivers provide. Elected leaders are now realizing that the traditional economy based on cattle ranching and logging is unsustainable. Deforestation proceeds apace, but the federal government is implementing the Protected Areas Programme for Amazonia, which seeks to protect 50 million ha, and a number of state governments are now active in creating protected areas and incorporating appropriate conservation measures in their development plans.},

abstract = {The post-dispersal fate of seeds and fruit (diaspores) of three vertebrate-dispersed trees, Crataegus monogyna, Prunus mahaleb and Taxus baccata, was studied in the Andalusian highlands, south-eastern Spain. Exclosures were used to quantify separately the impact of vertebrates and invertebrates on seed removal in relation to diaspore density and microhabitat. The three plant species showed marked differences in the percentage of diaspores removed, ranging from only 5{\%} for C. monogyna to 87{\%} for T. baccata. Although chaffinches (Fringilla coelebs) fed on diaspores, rodents (Apodemus sylvaticus) were the main vertebrate removers of seed and fruit. Two species of ant (Cataglyphis velox and Aphaenogaster iberica) were the only invertebrates observed to remove diaspores. However, the impact of ants was strongly seasonal and they only removed P. mahaleb fruit to any significant extent. While removal of seed by rodents was equivalent to predation, ants were responsible for secondary dispersal. However, their role was limited to infrequent, small-scale redistribution of fruit in the vicinity of parent trees. Rodents and ants differed in their use of different microhabitats. Rodents foraged mostly beneath trees and low shrubs and avoided open areas while the reverse was true of ants. Thus, patterns of post-dispersal seed removal will be contigent on the relative abundance and distribution of ants and rodents. Studies which neglect to quantify separately the impacts of these two guilds of seed removers may fail to elucidate the mechanisms underlying patterns of post-dispersal seed removal. The coincidence of both increased seed deposition by the main avian dispersers (Turdus spp.) and increased seed predation with increasing vegetation height suggested that selection pressures other than post-dispersal seed predation shape the spatial pattern of seed dispersal. Rather than providing a means of escaping post-dispersal seed predators, dispersal appears to direct seeds to microhabitats most suitable for seedling survival. Nevertheless, the reliance of most vertebrate-dispersed trees on regeneration by seed and the absence of persistent soil seed banks imply that post-dispersal seed predators may exert a strong influence on the demography of the plants whose seeds they consume. Even where microsites are limited, the coincidence of the most suitable microhabitats for seedling establishment with those where seed predation is highest provide a means by which selective seed predators can influence community composition.},

abstract = {Few species are likely to be so evident that they will always be detected at a site when present. Recently a model has been developed that enables estimation of the proportion of area occupied, when the target species is not detected with certainty. Here we apply this modeling approach to data collected on terrestrial salamanders in the Plethodon glutinosus complex in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, USA, and wish to address the question "how accurately does the fitted model represent the data?" The goodness-of-fit of the model needs to be assessed in order to make accurate inferences. This article presents a method where a simple Pearson chi-square statistic is calculated and a parametric bootstrap procedure is used to determine whether the observed statistic is unusually large. We found evidence that the most global model considered provides a poor fit to the data, hence estimated an overdispersion factor to adjust model selection procedures and inflate standard errors. Two hypothetical datasets with known assumption violations are also analyzed, illustrating that the method may be used to guide researchers to making appropriate inferences. The results of a simulation study are presented to provide a broader view of the methods properties. {\textcopyright} 2004 American Statistical Association and the International Biometric Society.},

abstract = {During the development of a study about a community of carnivorous mammals, an otter was captured and equiped with a radio transmitter in an area of mangrove in the south coast of the State of S{\~{a}}o Paulo, southeast of Brazil. This study verified that: 1 - the animal used at least three burrows without communication between them. 2 – the most used burrow was at a distance of 2,6 km from the capture place; 3 - this individual usually moved between two islands that were separated by an estuary whose medium width was of approximately 1 km; 4 – it spent a long period on a small island of approximately 0,06 Km2 where a muddy substratum prevailed, not allowing the construction of a burrow. In spite of the little time that the otter stayed with the radio-transmitter, the data obtained are of relevant importance as they show an unknown activity pattern, besides showing in a short period some patterns of burrow use. Even though the otter removed its radio-collar, it didn't cause any damage to the individual and it allowed the registration of behaviour patterns that had not been described before. Based upon the radio-transmitter as adapted, new perspectives open up for the effective study of this species, increasing the possibilities of obtaining data about activity patterns and home range for Lontra longicaudis.},

abstract = {The effects of habitat configuration on species persistence are predicted to be most apparent when remaining habitat cover is below 30{\%}. We tested this prediction by comparing vertebrate communities in 21 landscapes located in the southern Amazonia, including 7 control landscapes (similar to 100{\%} of forest cover) and 14 fragmented landscapes (4 x 4 km). The fragmented landscapes retained similar proportions of forest (similar to 25{\%}), but had contrasting configurations, resulting from two different deforestation patterns: the ``fish-bone pattern{\{}''{\}} common in small properties, and the large-property pattern generally used by large ranchers. Vertebrates were surveyed in all landscapes in February-July 2009 with interviews (n = 150). We found a significant difference in reported species richness among the fish-bone, large-property, and control areas (mean = 29.3, 38.8 and 43.5 respectively). Control areas and large-properties tended to have a higher number of specialist species (mean = 13.7, and 11.7, respectively), when compared with the fish-bone pattern (5.1). Vertebrate community composition in the control and large-properties was more similar to one another than to those of the fish-bone landscapes. The number of fragments was the main factor affecting the persistence of species, being negatively associated with specialist species richness. Species richness was also positively related with the size of the largest fragment structurally connected to the studied landscapes (i.e., a regional scale effect). Our results demonstrated that the large-property pattern, which results in less fragmented landscapes, can maintain a more diverse community of large vertebrates, including top predators, which are considered fundamental for maintaining ecosystem integrity. These results support the hypothesis that landscape configuration contributes to the persistence and/or extirpation of species.},

abstract = {Recent advances in the ecology of food webs underscore the importance of detritus and indirect predator-prey effects. However, most research considers detritus as an invariable pool and predation as the only interaction between carnivores and prey. Carrion consumption, scavenging, is a type of detrital feeding that should have widespread consequences for the structure and stability of food webs. Providing access to high-quality resources, facultative scavenging is a ubiquitous and phylogenetically widespread strategy. In this review, we argue that scavenging is underestimated by 16-fold in food-web research, producing inflated predation rates and underestimated indirect effects. Furthermore, more energy is generally transferred per link via scavenging than predation. Thus, future food-web research should consider scavenging, especially in light of how major global changes can affect scavengers. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

I argue that this phase of mathematics education is dominated by two factors. First, there is the ?value? of mathematics to the learner and to society at large, which shapes all choices, decisions and strategies. Second, there is the fact of adolescence and the special demands on mathematics education this poses, for theoretical thinking, for identity, and for relationships. In our project, we adopted mixed methods approaches to capturing the ?whole person? of the mathematics learner (and teacher): their sense of self and motivation, their disposition to learn mathematics, and their mathematics self-efficacy. The key contradiction that emerges is that, between the use and exchange value of mathematical knowledge, whether for the learner, the teacher, the institution, or wider society and culture. I discuss the prospects for a theory of value in Activity theory and in Bourdieu's sociology.},
